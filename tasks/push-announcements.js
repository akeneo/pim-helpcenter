 * It's possible that we would like to delete an announcement due to a mistake.

 * Another solution would be to delete all the docs in firestore, and re-insert everything. As there is no transaction,
 * it would be possible during a small amount of time to have inconsistent data when it pushes the announcements.
 * It could impact negatively the experience in the PIM and that's why it does delta delete instead.
