Finally, Akeneo PIM 4.0 also offers a new Connections functionality that simplifies the ability to connect Akeneo PIM to other applications from the user interface.</p>
                <p>This new release also delivers improvements to Franklin Insights, along with additional performance improvements for CSV/XLSX and API-based import and export.</p>
