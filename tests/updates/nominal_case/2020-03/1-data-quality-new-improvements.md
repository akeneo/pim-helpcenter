To help you measure and improve your product data quality, **our Data Quality Insights recommendation tab and grades are now available for your variant products**.

Get specific enrichment and consistency grading scores for all your product variants and quickly identify the list of attributes you need to improve for a specific variant product whether these attributes are at the product model or the variant level.

## Spell-check improvements
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Data Quality Insights, Spell-check, Data Quality" available="early March" link-to-doc="../articles/improve-data-quality.html#improve-data-quality"
:::

To help reach a higher data quality content yet, **spell-check and suggestions are now available on text area attributes with rich text editor enabled** (WYSIWYG).

The spell-check feature now **supports four new languages**: Italian ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹, Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª, Danish ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±. This means that you can now have spelling mistakes automatically detected for no more than 8 locales. Mistakes are no longer allowed! :wink:
