# Find which products are linked to a given reference entity
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.2"

Version 3.2 introduces a new Products tab so you can easily access products directly from the reference entity record.  
By default, the first 20 products are listed. Above the grid the total number of linked products are noted.

To see all products, simply click `View all products`. To view or edit a linked product, simply click on it and it will open its product form.

The advantage of this feature is that PIM users can see at a glance what products are linked to a given reference entity, and rapidly access a product directly from the reference entities screen, saving clicks, enhancing productivity, and delivering a better user experience.
