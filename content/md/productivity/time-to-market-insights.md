### Metrics

Two metrics to analyze your time-to-market performance:
- Time-to-enrich: the amount of time spent from the creation of the product to the first 100% completeness
- Number of enriched products: total number of products enriched over the defined period of time

### Dimensions

You can analyze the selected metric by grouping through entities: Families and Categories.
- Family: how you have defined completeness for products according to a set of required Attributes to be enriched
- Category: how you have organized and classified your products in Akeneo PIM

Also, you can go deeper into your analysis through the channels and the locales: 
- All: select “All Channels” or “All Locales” to get a broad overview of your product catalog across the board
- At Least one: choose “At least one Channel” or “At least one Locale” 
- Choose a specific channel or locale for focused insights in a particular area

### Time frame (From)

You can define the time frame you want to display for your analysis

## Dashboard and table vizualisation
