### Metrics and Filters

#### Metrics

Two metrics to analyze your time-to-market performance:
- Time-to-enrich: the amount of time spent from the creation of the product to the first 100% completeness
- Number of enriched products: total number of products enriched over the defined period of time

::: info
Please note that the updates on existing products are not taken into account in the metric calculation
:::

#### Dimensions

You can analyze the selected metric by grouping through entities: Families and Categories.
- Family: how you have defined completeness for products according to a set of required Attributes to be enriched
- Category: how you have organized and classified your products in Akeneo PIM

Also, you can go deeper into your analysis through the channels and the locales: 
- All: select `All Channels` or `All Locales` to get a broad overview of your product catalog across the board
- At Least one: choose `At least one Channel` or `At least one Locale` 
- Choose a specific channel or locale for focused insights in a particular area

#### Time frame (From)

You can define the time frame you want to display for your analysis.

### Export

Based on the filters defined on the control panel (Dimensions and Time frame), you can export the data for all the displayed metrics. Once you click on "Download report", an XLXS file is downloaded in your browser, and you can access the data related to the control panel configuration. 

## Dashboard and table vizualisation
