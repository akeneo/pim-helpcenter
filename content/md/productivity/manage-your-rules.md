# Overview

A rule allows you to automatically enrich some of your product information. It relies on automatic actions based on conditions. A rule is composed of one or several conditions, that allow you to filter products/product models, and then one or several actions to update these products/product models.  
For more details, please refer to our dedicated article about [the rules engine](get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html).

To create a rule, there are two options. Either you create it via the UI, or via a YML import job.

# Create a rule in the PIM UI

:::warning
To be able to create/edit rules, you need to have the right permissions. To manage your permissions, please go to `System/Roles`, select the appropriate role and then, click on `Permissions/Rules`, and tick `Create rules` and/or `Edit rules`.
:::

To create a rule via the UI, go to `Settings/Rules` and click on `Create`. A creation popin appears. Choose a **code** and a **label** to name your rule, then validate. You rule is created! You can now define your product selection and the action.s you want to apply to your selection. Let's go!

Once your rule is created, the rule edit screen appears. On this screen, you can see two tabs: the `rule builder` and `properties`. In the `Properties` tab, you can define the [priority](what-is-a-rule.html#definition-of-a-rule) of your rule, but also its label translations. These fields can be updated afterward. The code is the only part that is immutable.

## The Rule builder tab

This screen is the most important one as this is where you can manage your conditions and actions.

The first thing to do is to filter the products you want to update with this rule. To do so, there are a bunch of filters available under the `Add condition` button.

### Product selection
In the `Product selection` part, you can define the 'Conditions'. They are the attributes or system fields you want to use to filter your products/product models. Altogether, your `Conditions` will create your 'Product selection'.

:::info
If you want to know what is the entire [list of attributes/system fields](get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html) take a look at our article.
:::

:::warning
By default, when there is no condition, your whole product catalog is selected. So if you add one or several actions, your whole catalog will be updated!
:::

At the top of the list, you will find the system fields and below, all the attributes gathered by attribute groups. There is a search bar to help you find the attributes. Each time you add a condition, its color turns to purple to inform you that it is already used. A new line appears in the product selection.

Let's see how a line is organized.

On the left, you will find the **system** fields or **attribute** you chose. It is written in purple.
Then, you have to choose an **operator**. Depending on the filter, the operator list changes.
The next fields vary depending on your filter. There can be up to 3 types of fields. You can have the **value** field. For example, if your filter is a multi-select attribute type, you can choose which options you want to filter on.

If your filter has a value per channel and/or per locale, the `channel` and `locale` fields appear, in order to let you choose which locale/channel you want to filter on.

If you want to remove a condition, just click on the cross at the end of the line.

As you can see on the left side of the `Add condition` button, there is a counter that tells you how many products/product models will be updated by this rule. It means that these conditions will impact X products/product models.
This count is automatically updated as soon as you change a condition.

#### Available conditions

To select your products/product models, you can use all the system fields and attribute types of the PIM as `conditions`:

- Categories
- Family
- Family variant
- Groups
- Status
- Entity type (product or product model)
- Identifier
- Completeness
- Parent
- Creation date
- Update date
- Asset collection attribute
- Date attribute
- File attribute
- Image attribute
- Measurement attribute
- Multi select attribute
- Simple select attribute
- Number attribute
- Text attribute
- Boolean attribute
- Text area attribute
- Reference entity single link & multiple link attributes
- Price attribute

### Add actions

Now that you have filtered your products/product models, you can add one or several actions you'll apply to them!

To do so:
1. Click on `Add action` at the top of the screen
1. Select the action you want to add. There is a search bar and a scroll bar to choose the action from a list.
1. A new section appears under the `Product selection` part.

Here is the [list of all the actions](get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html) you can do with the rules engine if you use the YML file import.

Depending on the action you choose, the template changes. The table below lists all the actions that you can add via the PIM interface.

# Create rules via a YML import
To create rules using a YML file, you need to [create](get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html) it and import it in the PIM using the `Rule import in YML` import job.

::: info
For more details about how to execute an import, please refer to [Import your data](imports.html).
:::

:::tips
You can also export your rules. For that, execute the `Rule export in YML` export job. For more details about how to execute an export, please refer to [Export your data](exports.html).
:::


# View all rules

The `Settings/Rules` screen displays a grid with all the rules that have been created and imported in the PIM.  
You can search on the rule code or label.

![image](../img/Settings_Rules.png)

In the last column, there is a tag. Thanks to these tags, you can see at a glance the action type behind each rule (add, copy, concatenate, set, calculate, remove, clear) :wink:

You can order your rules by priority.

# Calculate the number of impacted products per rule

To help you define the conditions for your rules and validate them, you can calculate the number of matching products that the rule will process.

The first time a rule is executed, it can match many products. The following time, you might have zero `Impacted products` or only a few.

1.  To use this action, select one or several rules by ticking them on the left side of the screen
1.  Click on `Calculate the impacted products`
1.  Then confirm the action in the pop in
1.  A flash message confirming the action will be displayed and you will be notified once the calculation is done.

![image](../img/Rules_CalculateImpactedProducts.png)

The number of impacted products will appear on the right side of your screen in the `Impacted products` column.


# Execute rules

:::info
Rules are automatically executed 4 times a day: at 5 am UTC, at 11 am UTC, at 5 pm UTC and at 11 pm UTC.
Rules are also regularly executed after a bulk action or after imports with rules.
:::

But you can also execute rules on your own. You can execute:
*   one specific rule
*   a selection of rules
*   all your rules (be aware, this action could take a long time)

:::info
The rules support [product models](what-about-products-variants.html#what-is-a-product-model), so rules can be defined also on attributes at the product model level (or sub product model level).
:::

The rules execution summary is accessible via the `process tracker`.

![image](../img/Rules_ProcessTracker.png)

In this summary, you can easily access the details of the execution: how many rules were executed, how many products/product models were updated, warnings...

![image](../img/Rules_Summary.png)

:::tips
In order to access the summary of nightly scheduled rules (by cron), you need to have the right to `View all jobs in process tracker` in the `Roles` permissions to be able to see them the process tracker :wink:.
:::

## Execute a single rule

To execute a rule, click on the `Execute` button at the end of each line in the grid.  
A confirmation message validates the action of executing a rule.

![image](../img/Rules_Execute.png)

If you are editing/creating a rule in the rule edit form, you can execute it as well, just click on `...` then `Save and execute`.

## Execute a selection of rules

You can also execute several rules at the same time:
1.  Select one or several rules by ticking them on the left side of the screen
1.  Click on `Execute`
1.  Then confirm the action in the pop in
1.  A flash message confirming the action will be displayed and you will be notified once the execution is done

![image](../img/Rules_BulkExecution.png)

# Define a status for a rule

Sometimes, you may need to create/update a rule, save it, but ***not*** execute it automatically, because you will need to finetune it later for instance. To do so, you can use the `Status` property.

To change the status, just click on the `Properties` tab of a rule and choose between `Enabled` or `Disabled`.

![Status of a rule](../img/Rules_Status.png)

You can see at a glance the status of each rule in the rules grid.

:::info
By default, each new rule you create via the UI is disabled.
:::

# Duplicate a rule

Let's say that you have very similar rules with only one different condition for instance. In order to avoid re-writing the whole rule, you can **duplicate** it.  

To duplicate a rule, just access the rule edit form, click on `...` then `Save and duplicate`. The creation popin opens and you can choose a code and a label for your new rule.

![Duplicate a rule](../img/Rules_Duplicate.png)

:::warning
By default, when you duplicate a rule, it is disabled. To execute it, you have to change its status, under the `Properties` tab of the rule.
:::

# Delete rules

::: warning
A deleted rule can no longer be executed by the rules engine. The products keep the values calculated by the deleted rule.
:::

## Delete a single rule

To delete a rule, click on `Delete` at the end of each line in the grid.  
A confirmation message validates the action of deleting a rule.

![image](../img/Rules_Delete.png)

::: info  
If you do not see the `Delete` button, it might be because you do not have the right permissions. Please refer to [Manage your user roles](build-your-user-roles.html).
:::

## Delete a selection of rules

You can also delete several rules at the same time:
1.  Select one or several rules by ticking them on the left side of the screen  
1.  Click on `Delete`
1.  Then, confirm the action in the pop in.

![image](../img/Rules_MassDelete.png)
