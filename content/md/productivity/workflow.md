# Overview

Thanks to the Enterprise Edition permissions on categories and attribute groups, you can elaborate workflows to enrich your products. Some users will have ownership of products, they will be able to approve or reject contributions sent from users having only the edit permissions on categories.

# Statuses of products

In the Enterprise Edition version, two more product information are displayed on the product’s header:
- The user group(s) owner of the product
- The status of the product form, see below for more information about product form’s statuses.

For further details on the user group(s) in charge of the product, you can review the section “Send my product proposal for approval”.

The statuses visible on the Product Edit Form enable you to know which information is displayed in the form. You can have the following statuses on the product form:
- **Working copy:** this is the current form approved by the Product Manager.
- **In progress:** this is the approved product form with your changes in progress. In other words, this a draft for your product form.
- **Waiting for approval:** you are waiting for your draft to be approved by the product manager.

# Contribute to a working copy

A product edit form will have the «working copy» status if you did not previously submit new values for the product information (attributes).

If you have permissions to edit or view an attribute group, the group will appear in the attribute groups list on the left side of the product form.

If you have no permission, you will not see the groups.

If you only have the view permission (only read access no edition possible), the attributes will be displayed but you will not be able to edit them. They will appear as grayed out.

You are able to edit all the product’s attributes of an attribute group on which you have the edit permission on the product values of the relevant locale.

Be aware, your proposal has not been sent yet for approval/refusal.

You have now created your own working copy of the product! How could you say?
- The status record has been changed into “In progress”
- All new changes applied are displayed. For each change an icon is visible nearby the attribute. Place your mouse over the icon, you can view the ongoing approved value.
    ![image](../img/Products_PEFInProgress.png)
- A new button is prompted in blue “Send for approval“: for further details on this action, please refer to the section “Send my product proposal for approval“.

You can come back later on your product draft version to finish your enrichment work on the product.

# Contribute on my product’s draft

A product edit form will have the “In progress” status after you propose new values for the product information (attributes), it also means it has not been yet sent for approval to product managers.

You can send your draft for approval at any time to the product manager. Please refer to the section “Send my product proposal for approval”.

## Carry on working on the product’s proposal

If you change an information that you have not yet recorded, it will be added to your draft when you will save it.

Case 1: the description attribute, no value has been yet approved. The value you are saving = “example of description” is added to your draft. If you edit an information you have already saved, the new changes will be saved in your draft. The old values will be deleted.

Case 2: the description attribute, no value has been yet approved. The saved value is “example of description“ but you change it into “This product is awesome”.

When you click on the “Save Draft” button, the value “This product is awesome” will be added to your draft, and the value “example of description” will be deleted from your draft.

If you propose the same value as the one that has been already approved, the value will not be added to your draft.

For example: the weight attribute. Its approved value corresponds to “5 KG”. You have changed the value to “50 KG” and you save the value. Then you realize that you have made a mistake and enter “5 KG” and you click on the save button. No value will be recorded in your draft for the “Weight” attribute. It will remains “5 KG”.
