# Display key figures

The project widget will display key information on your dashboard, including the number of products which have none of their required attributes populated in the `TODO` section, the number of products partially completed in the `IN PROGRESS` section, and finally the number of products that are complete in the `DONE` section.

Each section displays the relative percentage of products falling under that status.

When you are working on a project it is also added to the widget with 3 key figures:

| Labels | Definitions |
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TODO**                   | Number of products with no required attributes filled in the user can edit |
| **% TODO PRODUCTS**        | (Number of TODO products*100) / number of products I have to enrich         |
| **IN PROGRESS**            | Number of products with at least one required attribute the user can edit  |
| **% IN PROGRESS PRODUCTS** | (Number of IN PROGRESS products*100) / number of products I have to enrich  |
| **DONE**                   | Number of complete products with all required attributes the user can edit |
| **% DONE PRODUCTS**        | (Number of DONE products*100) / number of products for which enrichment is complete  |

# Navigate to the product grid

When you display the project widget, you can easily see the products by clicking on the figures.
For example if you click on the widget `In Progress` which displays 25 as a figure, the product grid will be prompted and filtered with the 25 products.

::: info
If you create a project including product models, the project widget will always display the number of variant products. If you click on a project widget, the product grid will likewise display variant products which the user can enrich.
