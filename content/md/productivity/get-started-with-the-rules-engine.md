The rules engine can radically boost your productivity in the PIM by automating actions. As explained in [this article](what-is-a-rule.html), a rule enables you to automatically apply **one or several actions** to a specific **list of products and product models**. To set the targeted products, you have to define `conditions` (that are composed by fields and operators).  

The rules are defined in a YML file that you can import in the PIM, using a dedicated job profile.   

This feature is very, like, really powerful, and the usecases are countless. In order to guide you in the rules engine usage, we wrote this article where you will find out what you can use it for and how it works.


# Available actions

As of today, 5 actions are available in the rules engine:
- copy
- add
- set
- remove
- concatenate

What are these actions for? Let's discover it :wink:

## Copy

The `Copy` action enables you to copy an attribute value in another one.

The expected values are:
 - `from_field`: the code of the attribute to be copied
 - `to_field`: the attribute code where the value will be copied
 - `from_locale`: the locale code of the value to be copied *(optional)*
 - `from_scope`: the channel code of the value to be copied *(optional)*
 - `to_locale`: the locale code where the value will be copied *(optional)*
 - `to_scope`: the channel code where the value will be copied *(optional)*

You can only copy the given attribute to a selection of attribute types that we defined based on logical criteria:
#### You can copy the option code of a **simple select** attribute to:
- a **reference entity single link** attribute *(the record must already exist)*
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute

#### You can copy the option codes of a **multi select** attribute to:
- a **reference entity multiple link** attribute *(the records must already exist)*
- a **text** attribute *(the codes are separated by a comma)*
- a **textarea** attribute *(the codes are separated by a comma)*

#### You can copy the value of a **text** attribute to:
- a **textarea** attribute
- a **simple select** attribute *(the option code must already exist)*
- a **reference entity single link** attribute *(the record must already exist)*

#### You can copy the value of an **identifier** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute

#### You can copy the value of a **date** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute

:::info
The date will be copied into the ISO 8601 format (ex: 2019-01-25T12:00:00+01:00).
:::

#### You can copy the value of a **metric** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute
- a **number** attribute

#### You can copy the value of a **number** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute
- a **metric** attribute

#### You can copy the value of a **price** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute

#### You can copy the value of a **reference entity single link** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute
- a **simple select** attribute *(the option code of the simple select attribute must already exist)*

#### You can copy the value of a **reference entity multiple links** attribute to:
- a **text** attribute
- a **textarea** attribute
- a **multi select** attribute *(the option codes of the multi select attribute must already exist)*



### Example

You have a *scopable* and *localizable* attribute called `description`. You can copy its content from the `en_US` locale and the `print` channel to the `en_US` locale and the `e-commerce` channel. The action will be defined as follows:

```YML
  actions:
      - type: copy
          from_field: description
          from_locale: en_US
          from_scope: print
          to_field: description
          to_locale: en_US
          to_scope: ecommerce
```

## Add

The `Add` action allows you to add values to a multi-select attribute or a reference entity multiple link attribute. Also, it makes it possible to add a product to categories and to groups too.

The expected values are:
- `field`: the attribute code or property
- `items`: the value codes. It has to be an array of the items you need to add.
- `locale`: the locale code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `scope`: the channel code for which the value is assigned (optional)

### Example

To add the “t-shirts” category to a set of products, the action will be as follows:

```YML
  actions:
      - type: add
          field: categories
          items:
            - t-shirts
```

## Set

The `Set` action assigns value(s) to every attributes, categories, family, groups, or the "enabled" field.

The expected values are:
- `field`: the attribute code or property
- `value`: the attribute value or property value
- `locale`: the locale code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `scope`: the channel code for which the value is assigned (optional)

### Example

To set the *“My very new description for purple T-shirt”* value to your `description` attribute in the `en_US` locale and for the `e-commerce` channel, the action will be as follows:

```YML
  actions:
      - type:   set
          field:  description
          locale: en_US
          scope:  ecommerce
          value:  "My very new description for purple tshirt"
```

## Remove

The `Remove` action enables you to remove values from a multi-select attribute, a reference entity multiple link attribute, a product category or a group.

The expected values are:
- `field`: the attribute code or “categories”
- `items`: the value codes to remove
- `locale`: the locale code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `scope`: the channel code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `include_children`: if true, then it also applies the removal of the children to the given categories. It is only applicable if the field is set to “categories” (It's optional. By default, it is set to false)


### Example

To remove the “t-shirts” category, the action will be as follows:

```YML
  actions:
      - type: remove
          field: categories
          items:
            - t-shirts
```

To remove the “clothing” category and its children, the action will be as follows:
```YML
  actions:
      - type: remove
          field: categories
          items:
            - clothing
          include_children: true
```

To unclassify products from the whole “Master catalog” tree, the action will be as follows:

```YML
  actions:
      - type: remove
          field: categories
          items:
            - master
          include_children: true
```

## Concatenate

The `Concatenate` action concatenates at least two values into a single value. A space separates each source value.

:::info
The action is only for attribute values :wink:.
:::

The possible source attribute types are:
 - text
 - textarea
 - date
 - identifier
 - metric
 - number
 - price collection
 - simple select
 - multi select (values are separated by a comma)
 - reference entity single link
 - reference entity multiple link

The possible target attribute types are:
 - text
 - textarea

**The parameters `from` and `to` are required in this format. Depending on the source attribute type, some optional keys can be added.**

The expected values are:

**`from`**
- `field`: the attribute code.
- `locale`: the locale code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `scope`: the channel code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- For the `date` attribute: the format of the date following the PHP format [specification](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) (Optional). By default, it is *Y-m-d* (e.g. *2020-01-31*)
- For the `price collection` attribute: the currency code for which the price is assigned (optional). By default, all the prices in the collection are displayed, separated by a comma.
- For `simple select`, `multi-select`, `reference entity single link` and `reference entity multiple link` attributes: in *label_locale*, the expected value is the locale code for the label of the option or record (optional). By default, the code of the option is used.

**`to`**
- `field`: the attribute code.
- `locale`: the locale code for which the value is assigned (optional)
- `scope`: the channel code for which the value is assigned (optional)

### Example

To concatenate the **brand** (non localizable and non scopable) and the **model** in the `en_US` locale into the **product title** value in the `en_US` locale, the action will be as follows:

```YML
  actions:
    - type: concatenate
      from:
          - field: brand
          - field: model
            locale: en_US
      to:
          field: product_title
          locale: en_US
```

# Available fields

Now that you have discovered all the [available actions](#available-actions), you can easily see which ones can be useful in your daily work :wink:. But, to write a rule, you have to define your product selection. To do so, you need to know what are the available **fields** and their **operators**.

:::info
Keep in mind that the filters (or "fields") that are used in the rules, are the same than in the product grid.
:::

As of today, 7 fields are supported in the rules engine, and each of them has it's own business rules. Here we go!

# A real example
You're done with all these specifications!

We hope that you perfectly understand the rules engine operation now. But to make it crystal clear, we thought it would be better to take a real example of a rule :wink:.

Let's say that, among all the attributes of your product form, you have one `price collection` attribute type and a `boolean` attribute type.
In the price collection, you define the price of your product in USD. The boolean attribute is used to define if your product is ready to be sent to your ecommerce platform (if it is set to "yes", it means that the product is ready).

Manually changing the status of the boolean attribute is time-consuming and a very repetitive task... But for the rules engine, it's a perfect match!
The mission of the rules engine here is to **automate the status change of the boolean once the price attribute has a value.**

To do so, follow these steps:
1. Open a text editor to write the YML code of the rule.
1. Write this:

```YML
my_rule:
  conditions:
    - field: basic_price
      operator: NOT EMPTY
      value:
        amount: null
        currency: EUR
  actions:
    - field: ecommerce_ready
      value: true
      type: set
```

And finally, import your YML file using the Akeneo rules import job.


If you want to directly execute the rule:
1. Go to `Settings`, `Rules`
1. Click on the "play" button on your rule line and confirm.

The rule is executed :wink:.
