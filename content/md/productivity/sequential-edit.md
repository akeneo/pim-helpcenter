# Overview

Sequential edit enables to display one after the other the product forms from a selection of products, without going through the product grid. This will save time allowing the navigation directly between the product forms of the selected products.

Any user with product access with edit permissions can run a sequential edit. There is no specific right to provide access to this feature.

::: ee
If the user cannot edit any products from his product selection, then an error message is prompted to inform he cannot do the sequential edit.

# How to?

To start the product sequential edit:
1.  Search for products in the datagrid with the appropriate filters.
2.  Select the products on which you want to perform the operation via the selection tool: all the products recorded, all visible products from the ongoing page, none of the products and the products for which you have ticked the 1st column.

4.  The product edit page of the first product of the selection is prompted with a progress bar at the bottom of the page.

The progress bar tracks down the number of products that have already been changed from the total number of products of selected products. The progress bar is surrounded by two links on the left and right side.

The left link allows you to go back to the previous product, the right link to switch to the next one.

::: ee
If the user can edit at least one product from his selection, it means that the sequential edition has started. Only the products with the read-only access rights will be displayed.
