# Overview

Sequential edit enables to display one after the other the product forms from a selection of products, without going through the product grid. This will save time allowing the navigation directly between the product forms of the selected products.

Any user with product access with edit permissions can run a sequential edit. There is no specific right to provide access to this feature.

# How to?

To start the product sequential edit:
1.  Search for products in the datagrid with the appropriate filters
2.  Select the products on which you want to perform the operation via the selection tool:   
    - `All` for all the products recorded  
    - `All visible` for all visible products on the ongoing page  
    - `None` for none of the products

6. When all the products of your selection are enriched, click on the button `Save and finish` to come back to the product grid

The progress bar tracks the number of products that have already been changed from the total number of products of selected products. The progress bar is surrounded by two links on the left and right side.

The left link allows you to go back to the previous product, the right link to switch to the next one.
