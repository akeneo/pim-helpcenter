# The asset creation

Once you have [created an asset family](manage-asset-families.html#create-an-asset-family), you can add **assets**.
In the asset manager, you have 2 ways to add assets:
- unitary (one by one)
- or via the [mass upload](#upload-and-create-several-assets-at-the-same-time) feature.

## Add an asset

Letâ€™s say that you just have created the `Packshots` asset family, you have defined its asset attributes and now you want to create your first asset.

To add a new asset to the `Packshots` asset family:
1. Go to the Asset Manager
1. Select your `Packshots` family (the assets will automatically appear in the grid)
1. Then click on `Create` and select `Create an asset`.
1. Choose a label for the asset (the PIM will automatically take its label to generate your asset's code, but you can change it if needed).

::: info
Note that we have defined a limitation of 1 million assets per asset family to guarantee that the PIM is functional and runs smoothly.
:::

## Upload and create several assets at the same time

Assets mass upload is pretty convenient since it **automatically creates new assets from uploaded files**. The uploaded files will automatically be put in the attribute that you defined as *main media* in the asset family properties.

::: warning
As for the unitary creation, you have to be in an asset family to mass upload your files.
:::

:::tips
The uploaded files will be added to the attribute defined as `Attribute as main media` of the asset family. You can define and change this attribute in the `Properties` tab of an asset family.
:::

To mass upload assets:
1. Go to the `Assets` menu
1. Select your asset family in the dropdown button in the left panel
1. Click on `Create` then select `Upload assets`
![Upload assets](../img/Assets_UploadAssets.png)
1. Drag and drop your asset files in the page or click on `Drag and drop your files or click here` to open the dialog box and select the files you want to upload
1. Once all your files have the `ready to create` status, click on `Create`.
![Mass upload assets list](../img/Assets_MassUploadList.png)

::: tips
The code in automatically filled based on the filename but you can edit it directly in this screen. It cannot be edited afterwards.
:::

::: info
When files are added to the list, you can remove them whatever their status.  
To remove the file from the list, click on the `X` button at the end of the row. The file will be removed and will not be imported.

If you want to remove all files at once, click on the `Remove all` button. ;)
:::

::: warning
Only letters, numbers and underscores are allowed in an asset code, the other characters will be replaced by an underscore " _ ". i.e: if the file's name contains a minus sign character "-", it will be changed into an underscore sign " _ ", so the "picture-1.jpg" and "picture_1.jpg" will be linked to the same asset code "picture_1".

Pretty simple, isn't it?
If you need to have specific files per channel or per locale, there is another step to do.

### Special cases

#### My attribute used as main media is localizable
Let's say that in your asset family `Packshots`, the [attribute used as main media](manage-asset-families.html#define-the-asset-family-properties) (called `My_main_image`) is localizable. It means that you want to have different files depending on the locale.  

In the upload screen, a new column `Locale (required)` appears.

Note that if the filename contains the code of the locale (for example: `Alpha_1-en_US.png`), we automatically filled the locale field with `English (United States)`. You can change it if desired.  

![Upload localizable asset](../img/Assets_UploadLocalizableAssets.png)

If the filename doesn't contain the locale code:
- Upload your file (for instance `Alpha_1`) and choose in which locale you want to add it, by selecting the right locale in the dropdown field.
- Once it is done, you can click on `Create` to create the asset :)

#### My attribute used as main media is scopable
Let's say that in your asset family `Packshots`, the attribute used as main media (called `My_main_image`) is scopable. It means that you want to have different files depending on the channel.  

In the upload screen, a new column `Channel (required)` appears.

Note that if the filename contains the code of the channel (for example: `Alpha_1-ecommerce.png`), we automatically filled the channel field with `ecommerce`. You can change it if desired.

![Upload scopable asset](../img/Assets_UploadScopableAssets.png)

If the filename doesn't contain the channel code:
- Upload your file (for instance `Alpha_1`) and choose in which channel you want to add it, by selecting the right channel in the dropdown field.
- Once it is done, you can click on `Create` to create the asset :)


#### My attribute used as main media is localisable & scopable
Let's say that in your asset family `Packshots`, the attribute used as main media (called `My_main_image`) is localisable & scopable. It means that you want to have different files depending on the locale and on the channel.  

In the upload screen, two new columns `Locale (required)` and `Channel (required)` appear.

![Upload localizable and scopable asset](../img/Assets_UploadLocalizableAndScopableAssets.png)

Note that if the filename contains the code of the locale and the code of the channel (for example: `Alpha_1-en_US-ecommerce.png`), we automatically filled the locale and the channel fields with `English (United States)` and `ecommerce`. You can change it if desired.

::: warning
Please, make sure that the filename contains first the locale code, and then the channel code.

It won't work if the filename contains only the locale code or only the channel code whereas both are expected.
:::

If the filename doesn't contain neither the locale code neither the channel code:
- Upload your file (for instance `Alpha_1`) and choose in which locale and which channel you want to add it, by selecting the right locale and channel in the dropdown fields.
- Once it is done, you can click on `Create` to create the asset :)

::: info
To add the files of the other locales/channels, just click on your asset in the library, go on the right attribute, switch the locale/channel and add files directly in the asset form!
:::

Now that your Asset Manager is filled with many assets, it's time to dig into the asset library.

# The asset library
When you open the `Assets` menu, you discover the assets in a mosaic view, that we call the **asset library**.

![Asset library](../img/Assets_Library.png)

Assets are displayed by asset families. By default, the first asset family is selected.

::: info
If you don't have any asset family, the first thing to do is to [create your first one](manage-asset-families.html#create-an-asset-family), and then you will be able to add assets.
:::

# Search for assets
Because we really want to help you in your daily work, we focused our efforts on the search.

## Full text search

As for the Reference Entity feature, you benefit from a powerful search in the Asset Manager. With the **full text search**, you can search on code, label and text attribute types.

For example, if you search for the word *Ambient*, all the assets containing the word *Ambient* in their code, label or text attribute types will be displayed.  

![Search for assets with a keyword](../img/Assets_Search1Word.png)

In this example, this word is part of the `Label` or the `Description` attribute of the assets.

And we can go further.
If you search for *"famous"* and *"chest"*, then only the asset containing both *"famous"* and *"chest"* words will be displayed.

![Search for assets with several keywords](../img/Assets_Search2Words.png)

In this example, both words are part of the `Description` attribute of the assets.

## Filter on options

There are also filters on the left, where you retrieve the options of the single/multiple options attributes. It can be very powerful if you use these options to manage tags on your assets for example.

The operator is an `in list` operator. If you are looking for the images with the colors "Yellow" OR "Gray", the images with the colors "Yellow" OR the color "Gray" will be displayed.

You can combine filters. For instance, you can search on all images with:
- the colors "Yellow" OR "Gray"
- AND the "Living-room" room
- AND the "ambient" tag.

![Filters in the library](../img/Assets_FilterOptions.png)

An option can be removed from a filter using the cross.

To empty a filter, you can click on the eraser.
