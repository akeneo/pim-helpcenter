# Overview

Assets mass upload is pretty convenient especially if you want to update your asset catalog with external sources: photo shooting, new collection, etc...

The PIM uses the filename to know for which asset the file have to be used and if this asset is localized or not.
To check if the asset already exists, the PIM compares the existing assets codes with the file's name. 

:::warning
Only letters, numbers and underscores are allowed in an asset code, the other characters will be replaced by an underscore " _ ". i.e: if the file's name contains a minus sign character "-", it will be changed into an underscore sign " _ ", so the "picture-1.jpg" and "picture_1.jpg" will be linked to the same asset code "picture_1".  
:::

**Example 1 with a non-localized asset**  
If the filename is `main_picture_S1263547.jpg`, then the PIM will check:
- If the asset with the `main_picture_S1263547` code already exists, the PIM will update the asset with the `main_picture_S1263547` code by importing the `main_picture_S1263547.jpg` file as its new reference file (and will regenerate the variation files accordingly).
- If the asset doesnâ€™t already exist, the PIM will create a new asset with the `main_picture_S1263547` code and with the file as the reference file, so that the variation files can be generated.

**Example 2 with a localized asset**  
Another example, if the filename is `akene-en_US.pdf`, then the PIM will check:
- If the asset with the `akene` code already exists and if it is localized, the PIM will update the asset with the `akene` code by importing the `akene-en_US.pdf` file as the reference file for the given locale code at the end of the filename (`en_US`).
- If the asset with the `akene` code already exists and if it is not localized, the PIM will display an error message in red.
- If the asset with the `akene` code doesn't already exist, the PIM will create a new localized asset with the `akene` code and with the file as the reference file for the given locale code at the end of the filename (`en_US`).

:::warning
If the locale is disabled or doesn't exist in the PIM, the PIM will display an error message in red.

The report of the import is displayed.

::: info
When files are added to the list, you can remove them whatever their status.  
To remove the file from the list, click on the `X` button at the end of the row. The file will be removed and will not be imported.

If you want to remove all the files you chose at once, click on the `Remove all files` button at the top of the screen. ;)
