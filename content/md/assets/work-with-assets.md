# View the assets list

To start, go to the `Assets` menu. From this page, there are many ways to work within the asset grid below.

![View the assets list](../img/Assets_MainPage.png)

## Set up your work environment

Like for the product grid, you can set up a locale and a channel context, you can reduce and expand the categories panel, and use filters to easily find the assets you are looking for.

For more information about the grid, please refer to the [Get familiar with the grid](products-grid.html) article.

The filters can be applied on the following asset information:
- Code
- Description
- Tags
- End of use
- Creation date
- Last update date

::: info
The following information cannot be sorted out in the asset grid:
- Thumbnail
- Tags
:::

::: warning
Asset thumbnail images displayed in the grid are the selected channel's variations. If no image is displayed it is because you do not have any variations generated for this channel. See how to generate variations in the [Edit the files of an asset](work-with-assets.html#edit-the-files-of-an-asset) part of this article.
:::

## Asset grid display

To highlight the assets images, a `Gallery` display is available in the asset grid.

:::info
Grid features also apply to this display (filters, channel, locale and categories selection, pagination, assets selection, etc.).
:::

To use the `Gallery` display:
1.  Click on `List` to change the display  
  ![Select the asset grid display](../img/Assets_display.png)
1.  Select the display `Gallery`
  ![Gallery display of the asset grid](../img/Assets_gallery_display.png)

:::info
The context of the chosen display for the asset grid is kept.
:::

## Search by code

To quickly find assets in the assets grid, you can search on the code.

The behavior of the search is a "contains" filter. For example, if you type in "can", it will display all the assets with a code which contains "can".

1.  Click on the `Save` button.

The asset has been created and the asset form page is displayed.

## Create a new tag for an asset

When a tag is not available, if you continue to type it, you can use the `Enter` button of your keyboard to tell the PIM that you want to create the tag. It will be automatically created and it will be then available for other assets.

## Classify the asset into categories

An asset can be classified in one or more categories, but can also be left out of any categories in the PIM. The asset can either be classified in several categories of the very same tree or in different ones.

To classify one asset:
1.  Click on the `Categories` tab
1.  Click on the name of a tree you want on the left hand side
1.  Check the categories in which the asset has to be classified
1.  Uncheck the categories in which the asset should no longer be listed

1.  Click on `Delete` to confirm your action

::: info
Like a delete of a single asset, this action does not delete asset from the server.
:::

## Export assets

To export assets, you need to use several export profiles, first of all, run a basic product [export](exports.html#run-an-export): it contains the assets codes associated to products.
Then, you can run an assets variation export to get the asset's path on the server. In the exported file, you can find the original asset file path in the `reference_file` column and its channel's variations in the `variation_file` column.

::: info
Assets are not available through a URL nor exported in a zip folder like pictures.
:::

If you need the actual files, it's possible! Since asset files are stored in the `app/filestorage` folder, you can set up a cron task or a script to automatically export them to a FTP for instance.
