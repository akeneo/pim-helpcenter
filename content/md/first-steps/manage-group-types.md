# Overview

Groups are used to bring products together.

You can group all the products on a selection of products to create a theme, for example a collection of products on the same Christmas theme.

Groups types are required to create a product group in `Settings/Groups`.  
There is no default group. Akeneo advises to create a default group type with code “RELATED”.

# List the group types

To see the group types, edit them or create a new group type go to `Settings/Group types`.
