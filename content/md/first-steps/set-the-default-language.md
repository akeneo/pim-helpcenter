# The PIM interface language

You can set a default language for the interface, that will be used for all new users.

Most user interfaces in the PIM are translated in other languages than English.

Note that each user can configure the interface in its own language. For more information, do not hesitate to take a look at this [article](/articles/manage-your-account.html#your-interface-default-language).

For instance, your German team can have the PIM interface in German, whereas the US team will have the PIM in American English - this can be set in their user account.

# Choose the default language

1.  Log in with an admin user account
1.  Go to `System` and click on the `Configuration` menu entry
1.  In the `Localization` tab, select the default language from the `Language` dropdown

# Give us a hand with translations

You noticed there are some wordings in the PIM that are not properly translated in the language you are using. Guess what? You can help us improve our interface translations!

See [Give us a hand on **translating** the PIM](/articles/contribute-translations.html) for more information. ;)
