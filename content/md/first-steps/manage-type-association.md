# Overview

Associations types are used to link products together.

For example, you can link a product to its accessories. The code for this association type could be “ACCESSORIES”.

There are three different association types:
*   The 1-way association (when product A is associated with product B).
*   The 2-way association (when product A is associated with product B, then product B will be automatically associated with product A).
*   The association with quantities (when product A is associated with 2 quantities of product B and with 3 quantities of product C).

:::info
The association types are mandatory to create a link between two products. There is no default association types.
