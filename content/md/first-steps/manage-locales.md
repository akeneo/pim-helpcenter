# Overview

The locales are used to set values for attributes which may differ according to the relevant language/locale (for examples English UK (en_GB), English US (en_US), English AU (en_AU)).   
For more details, see [What is a locale](/articles/what-is-a-locale.html).

# View locales

To view locales, go to `Settings/Locales`.     
You can search on the localeâ€™s code and filter on its status `Activated`: All/Yes/No.
