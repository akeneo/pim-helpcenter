# Overview

You have 294 currencies available in Akeneo. Currencies are used to set values for the `Price` attribute type. Currencies are not related to locales.

::: info
When a `Price` attribute type is created, it can have as many values as needed as long as the relevant currency has been activated in the PIM.
:::

# View currencies

To view the currencies, go to `Settings/Currencies`. The grid displays all currencies available in the PIM.   
You can search on the currencyâ€™s code and filter on its status `Activated`: `All`/`Yes`/`No`.
