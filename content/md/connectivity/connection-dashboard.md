# Monitor your third-party **connections**

In the PIM, there is a dashboard to help you follow your [connections](what-is-a-connection.html) activity. It's called the `Connection dashboard`.

You can access it by clicking on the `Activity` menu, then on the `Connection dashboard` submenu. And here you are! :tada:
