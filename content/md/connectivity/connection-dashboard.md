# Overview

In the PIM, there is a dashboard, called the `Connection dashboard`, to help you follow your [connections](what-is-a-connection.html) activity. You can access it by clicking on the `Activity` menu, then on the `Connection dashboard` submenu. And here you are! :tada:

::: info
This is still the very first version of this dashboard. In the future, it will show you many more indicators. Stay tuned! üôÇ  
And also, don't hesitate to fill in the survey at the bottom of the dashboard page to vote for the next KPI you'd like to see in there.

In this dashboard, for now, you can monitor both your source and destination connections.

::: tips
Empty charts? Have you ticked the `Track this connection in the dashboard` checkbox in your connections settings? Do you use the connection user to call the PIM through the API?

# Source connection monitoring
In this dashboard, you can easily track the following indicators from your source connections:

- the number of products that were **created** and **updated** over the last 7 days for each source,
![Number of products created by each source](../img/number-of-products-created-updated.png)
- the number of products that were **created** and **updated** over the last 7 days by all your sources.

# Error monitoring

## In the Connection dashboard
In this dashboard, you can easily track **product errors** that occurred over the last 7 days. 
- The graph shows the number of product errors (business and technical), 
- and connection cards display the number of business errors for the past week.

::: info
Julia could solve **business errors** from the PIM or in the connected application. On the contrary, **technical errors** can't be resolved without a developer or a technical profile intervention.

For example, a `The title attribute must not contain more than 250 characters. The submitted value is too long.` error is considered as a business error because Julia could solve it by changing the value of the related attribute. But a `Property does not exist` error is regarded as a technical error because it can't be solved without modifying the connector.

## In the connection Monitoring page

You can access the `Monitoring` page by clicking directly on a connection card in the `Connection dashboard` or in the `System` menu, then `Connections`, and on your connection card. 

This page displays information about **the last 100 business errors**. 

Each message contains 3 parts:
- the message: to explain what went wrong during the connection synchronisation,
- internal links: to help you to check the right data inside your PIM,
- external links: to access directly the right pages in our help center.

Moreover, we display some information about the related product: 
- its label and identifier,
- its family,
- and when this is relevant, the attribute channel and locale.

Finally, above the list, you will find a search bar to filter messages. üîç
