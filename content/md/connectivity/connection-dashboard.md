# Overview

In the PIM, there is a dashboard to help you follow your [connections](what-is-a-connection.html) activity. It's called the `Connection dashboard`.

You can access it by clicking on the `Activity` menu, then on the `Connection dashboard` submenu. And here you are! :tada:

And also, don't hesitate to fill in the survey at the bottom of the dashboard page to vote for the next KPI you'd like to see in there.
