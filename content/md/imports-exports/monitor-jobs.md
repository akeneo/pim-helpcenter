# What is a job?

You have several ways to follow the status of a job. A job can be:
- an [import](imports.html),
- an [export](exports.html),
- a [mass edit](product-mass-actions.html),
- a [rules](what-is-a-rule.html) execution _(EE only)_
- a calculation of [project](what-is-a-project.html).

# How to monitor?
First, you are notified by a flash message when the job starts.

Then, when the job is completed, a notification appears on the top of your screen.

There is a Process Tracker page which will give you the full list of all jobs you launched. To access it, go to `Activity` and click on the `Process tracker`menu entry.
