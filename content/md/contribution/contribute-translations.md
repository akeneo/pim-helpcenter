# All about translations

By default, Akeneo PIM is set in English. We then usually manage to translate the wording in French internally. Thanks to some of our employees, we also manage to translate some other languages like Russian, Portuguese... but for other languages you might miss some wordings.

If you are using a language for which you noticed there are some wordings in the PIM that are not properly translated, do not hesitate to help us on this subject!

You'll see. This is very straight forward!

# Introducing Crowdin

Akeneo uses the application [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) which provides a collaborative environment for the community to translate the PIM. Feel free to create an account and submit translations for your language, this will be much appreciated. ;)

Access to [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) is free, simply register to access to [Akeneo project](https://fr.crowdin.com/project/akeneo) and start contributing!

For now, here is the current status on PIM translation on Crowdin.

Please note that any language whose completion reaches 70% will appear in the UI of the SaaS version.
