# Definition

![What is a user?](../img/What-is-a-user.svg)

Nothing exotic here. A user is simply an account access to log into the PIM.

::: info
One user account can only be used by one person in a company.
:::

A user has at least:
 - a firstname
 - a lastname
 - a username
 - a password
 - an email
 - a role.

::: ee
A user can belong to one or several [user groups](what-is-a-user-group.html). In the Enterprise Edition, this is really useful when you want to assign them permissions regarding the products data. By default, when a user is created, he does not belong to any user group. 
To know more about this subject, read [Build your user groups](build-your-user-groups.html).

# As a user you can...

As a user you can:
 - choose the language of your PIM interface to better understand what's going on :wink:
 - choose your favorite [view](manage-your-views.html) and working category tree to be even more productive
 - choose your favorite [locale](what-is-a-locale.html), [channel](what-is-a-channel.html) and other filters when you are working on the [product grid](products-grid.html)
