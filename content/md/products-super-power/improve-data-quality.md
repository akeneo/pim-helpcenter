# Improving data quality
Data quality is key in offering a compelling product experience to your customers.
In Akeneo PIM you can measure and follow your data quality on two axes: **enrichment** and **consistency**.

To get a glimpse of your catalog’s overall data quality we introduced a `data quality insights` dashboard.

You can choose the see the evolution of your data quality for:
- your entire catalog

# Improve data quality on variant products

If you work with variant products, you will see slight differences between grades and recommendations for simple products, product models and variant products.

For **product models**:
![Image data quality product model panel](../img/data-quality-model-panel.png)
- Data quality grades are calculated on the attributes that can be improved at the product model level.
- Recommendations are given for attributes at the product model level.

For **sub-product models**:
![Image data quality sub product model panel](../img/data-quality-sub-model-panel.png)
- Data quality grades are calculated based on the attributes that can be improved at the product model and sub-product model levels
- Recommendations are given for attributes at the product model and sub-product model levels. By clicking on an attribute name, you can go and improve an attribute in the product model or sub-product model.

For **variant products**:
![Image data quality variant panel](../img/data-quality-variant-panel.png)
- Data quality grades are calculated on the attributes that can be improved at all levels hence reflecting the data quality of the product that will be published. Data quality grades are therefore displayed in the left side bar only for product variant.
- Recommendations are given for all attributes by clicking on an attribute name, you can go and improve an attribute in the product model, the sub-product model or the variant product.

# Improve data quality on attribute labels and Options

From the `Settings` you can check and improve the data quality of your attribute labels and options.

![Image data quality attribute grid](../img/data-quality-attribute-grid.png)

In the 'quality' column, you can view whether the data quality for your attribute is "Good" or "To improve".
If the status is "To improve", you may need to correct either attribute labels for one or several locales and/or attribute options for one or several locales.

3. Use the spell-check suggestions to correct them
