# Improving data quality
Data quality is key in offering a compelling product experience to your customers.
In Akeneo PIM you can measure and follow your data quality on two axes: **enrichment** and **consistency**.

To get a glimpse of your catalog’s overall data quality we introduced a `data quality insights` dashboard.
