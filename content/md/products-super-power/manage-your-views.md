# Work with the views

What if, you could **save all changes made on your grid** (filters, columns, category selection...) and **come back later to the exact same view so you can keep on working on your product’s selection**? Well, this is possible with the **View** feature!

**Views are available for all users for all versions** (Community and Enterprise).

# Create a view

Before creating a view, **first select a category or a category tree, add some filters and add/remove columns**.
Once you are all set, you will see that the `Default view` name became `Default view*`. Every time you will make a change on a view, a small asterisk "\*" will be added nearby its name.

To create your first view:
1.  Click on the "..." nearby the view selector menu
![Create a view](../img/Products_CreateView.png)
1.  Select `Create view` in the dropdown
1.  A window will appear:
![Create a view window](../img/Products_CreateViewWizard1.png)
1.  Enter a name for your view
1.  Click on `Save` to record your view

This view will now be available under the Views dropdown menu.

Some rules about the views:
- **All views created are shared with all other users**.
- **Only the view’s creator can delete or edit it**.
- If you need to edit someone’s else view, select it, make your changes and save it again under a new name.
- **Only active filters will be saved for your view**. For instance, an attribute filtered on `ALL` will disappear when saving your view, because `ALL` is the default filter value.

::: info
When you create a new view, you can save a **grid configuration as well as active filters**. Please note that **system filters will be always added to your filter menu**, unless you customise default filters in your account. Read our [Manage your account](manage-your-account.html#your-favorite-catalog-and-product-grid-settings) article to learn more about default grid filters.
