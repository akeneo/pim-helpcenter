# Work with the views

What if, you could save all changes made on your grid (filters, columns, category selection...) and come back later to the exact same view so you can keep on working on your product’s selection? Well, this is possible with the View feature!

Views are available for all users for all versions (Community and Enterprise).

# Create a view

Before creating a view, first select a category or a category tree, add some filters and add/remove columns.

And once you are all set, you will see that the Default view name became Default view*. Every time you will make a change on a view, a small asterisk "\*" will be added nearby its name.

To create your first view:
1.  Click on the "..." nearby the view selector menu
![Create a view](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-helpcenter/blob/50fb2ce8d315a57c339df62e19e3c32a8fa49145/content/md/products-super-power/img/Products-CreateView.png)
1.  Select `Create view` in the dropdown
1.  A window will appear:

1.  Enter a name for your view
1.  Click on `Save` to record your view

This view will now be available under the Views dropdown menu.

Some rules about the views:
- All views created are shared to all other users.
- Only the view’s creator can delete or edit it.
- If you need to edit someone’s else view, select it, make your changes and save it again under a new name.
- Only active filters will be saved for your view. For instance, an attribute filtered on ALL will disappear when saving your view, because All is the default filter value.
