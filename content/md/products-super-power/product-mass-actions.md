# Overview

Bulk operations enable you to perform actions on multiple products at once. These operations are performed on a selection of products from the grid.

To access the bulk actions, go on the Product grid, **select at least one product** and click on the `Bulk actions` button, at the bottom of the grid.

# Available mass actions
Here’s the list of the bulk operations available in the PIM (Community and Enterprise Editions):
