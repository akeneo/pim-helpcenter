![Publish](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-helpcenter/blob/lucas/content/md/products-super-power/img/Products_PublishedGrid.png)

But some features will not be available on this grid:

*   You will not be able to create a new product from this page
*   You will not be able to delete any published products
*   You will not be able to modify any published products

The views are specific to the published product grid. Hence, the views of unpublished products are not shared with the grid of published products.

> **Notes**  
  1. Like for the product grid, you can define a default view when you open the published product grid in your user account, refer to Change your default preferences.
  2. This option is available in your account, only if you have already created a custom view in the published product grid, if not, the field will not appear.

The attributes, families, groups, and categories are taken into account by published product versions and cannot be deleted.

The visual guide to mass edit offers to execute specific operations on published products, just like “unpublishing products”.

It is not possible to edit published products, you can only view them.

## View a published product in detail

The display is the same as the unpublished product form. For more information, you can refer to the section, “Viewing a product form”. Also, if you do not have the appropriate rights to see some attribute groups at least, these latter will not be displayed.

# Unpublish products

Unpublishing products remove the product’s version from being used in the exports.

Unpublishing products only impacts the export of products. The export of attributes, categories, etc... does not take into account the concept of unpublishing product.

## Unpublish a single product

To unpublish one product:
1.  Go to the published product grid by clicking on the "..." in the top right corner of the product grid screen
1.  Click on the small cloud icon displayed on product rollover in the grid (see screenshot below)

You can also unpublish a product directly from the edit form.
