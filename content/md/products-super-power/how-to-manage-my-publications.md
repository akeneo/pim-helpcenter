But some features will not be available on this grid:

*   You will not be able to create a new product from this page,
*   You will not be able to delete any published products,
*   You will not be able to modify any published products.

The views are specific to the published product grid. Hence, the views of unpublished products are not shared with the grid of published products.

> **Notes**  
  1. Like for the product grid, you can define a default view when you open the published product grid in your user account, refer to Change your default preferences.
  2. This option is available in your account, only if you have already created a custom view in the published product grid, if not, the field will not appear.

The attributes, families, groups, and categories are taken into account by published product versions and cannot be deleted.

The visual guide to mass edit offers to execute specific operations on published products, just like “unpublishing products”.

It is not possible to edit published products, you can only view them.
