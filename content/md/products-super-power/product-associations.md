# Overview

A product may be associated with none or several other products or product groups. This type of link also called a relationship has a direction: e.g. Product “A” --> Product “B” and Product “A” --> Product Group ”G”. The Product “B” and the product group “G” have no link or associations with the product “A”.

::: info
This type of relationship enables you to define relationships like an alternative product or a substitution between products for example.
