# Overview

A product may be associated with none or several other products or product groups. This type of link has a direction: 1-way or 2-way. Please read our [Association Types documentation](manage-your-association-types.html#Overview) for more information.

These types of associations enable you to define relationships, such as an alternative product, a substitution between products, a cross-sell/up-sell option or even a product set composed of different quantities of products.

:::infos
Please note that you cannot associate more than 100 products/product models per one product/product model.
