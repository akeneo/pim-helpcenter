# Add a record
Once you have created a reference entity, you can add **records**.
Let’s say that you just have created the reference entity `Brand`, you have defined its records attributes and now it is time to add new records. For example: Fermob, Kartell, Muuto, Fatboy…

To add a new brand to the reference entity `Brand`:
1. Go to your `Brand` entity (you will automatically land on the records grid)
1. Then click on the `Add new` button, choose a label for the record (the PIM will automatically take its label to generate your record's code, but you can change it if needed).

![Create a record](Records_creation.png)

::: tips
If you have several records to add, you can stay in the creation pop-in to add quickly as many records as needed:
1. Input the first record label
1. Tick `Create another record`
1. Press `Enter`
1. Add the label for each record
1. Once you've done, press `Esc` or `Echap`   
:::

::: info
Note that we have defined a limitation of 1 million records per reference entity to guarantee that the PIM is functional and runs smoothly.

# Display records
To see the records of the reference entity, click on the `Records` tab in the left menu. You will see the records grid, where all the records of the entity are listed.

## The records grid
The records grid is quite different than the products' one. Thereafter are the specific features of this grid:
- The line with the attributes names is frozen: it allows you to scroll down the page, while **continuing to see the name of the attributes**
- The first 4 columns with image, label, code and completeness are also frozen. We added an **horizontal scroll** in order to see the content of all the columns
- We also added a tooltip to **preview the content** of a text attribute directly in the grid when you hover over the text
- Finally, the grid can display up to 500 results using an **infinite scroll**. If you have more results, please filter your search. When reaching this limit, the grid displays the message *"You just scrolled through the first 500 results out of 1450 records. To see more, try with more specific search criteria."*

::: info
In the records grid, you will see only certain types of attributes: code, text and image.
:::

Of course, you can still edit or delete a record thanks to the buttons at the end of each line.

# Search for a record

## Full text search

Our goal is to **facilitate your work** and to increase your productivity. To make this possible, we made a very powerful search in the grid of records. Indeed, we implemented a **full text search** which allows you to search on code, label and text attribute types.

For example, if you search for the word *« famous »*, all the records containing the word *« famous »* in their code, label or text attribute types will be displayed.  

![Search for records with a keyword](Records_Search_1_word.png)

And we can go further.
If you search for *"famous"* and *"bags"*, then only the record containing both *"famous"* and *"bags"* words will be displayed.

![Search for records with several keywords](Records_Search_2_words.png)

## Filter on completeness

You can also filter on completeness in order to see the records that are complete/incomplete, or choose to see all the records, no matter their completeness.

![Records filter on completeness](Records_filter_completeness.png)

::: tips
To know how to define the required attributes for the completeness, please take a look at this [article](/articles/manage-reference-entities.html)

# Edit a record

Of course, you can edit a record in order to change values or add new ones. Nothing simpler: just go on a record and add/change the values you want.

As for a product, you can define if you want a **different content according to channels**, and the same applies on **locales**.
You can find a **locale and channel switcher** on each record, meaning that if you need to translate values for example, you can do it simply switching from a locale to another.

![Locale switcher on the records grid](Records_locale_switcher.png)

In the Attribute tab, if you define a *"text area"* attribute for your records, you can tick the parameter `rich text editor`. This will give you access to a set of options to improve the format of your text. For example, you can change the font, the size, etc. You can also add a link, a video, an image.
In fact, the Rich text editor offers a large bunch of possibilities!

# Follow the records completeness

Like for products, we calculate [completeness](/articles/manage-reference-entities.html) on records.

In the records, several indicators show you the status of your completeness and which attributes are missing.
- **Yellow bullet points** in front of each missing required attribute, showing that you have to complete this attribute to improve the completeness.
- The **completeness percentage** in the header of the record informs you of the completeness level.   

The completeness is **automatically calculated** as soon as we enrich a required attribute. It means that the bullet point will disappear as soon as the required attribute is filled, and same for the completeness percentage evolution.


# Link a record to another record

It is also possible to link a record to another one, and it is very simple.

For example, you can link a *Designer* (let's say *"Philippe Starck"*) to the record *"Kartell"*, or to several records brands belonging to the *"Brands"* entity.  

![Records link entity](Records_link_entity_2.png)

Please refer to this [article](/articles/manage-reference-entities.html#add-an-attribute) to discover how to do so.

Once you have chosen which entity is linked, you can see a new selector with all the records of the linked entity.

::: tips
Click on the `link` icon on each record line in the selector to preview the record! It will automatically open a new tab in your browser.

# Delete records

## Delete a record
You can delete a record or all the records of an entity.
 To delete a record, 2 choices:
- Either directly in the records grid, by clicking on the *trash can* button on each record line.
- Either in the details of the record, by clicking on the `...` button at the top right corner of the header then `delete`.

## Delete all the records
To delete all the records of an entity, click on the `...` button at the top right corner of the header's records grid then `delete all records`.

::: tips
To delete all the records of an entity, you **need to check that no record of this entity is linked to other entities or used in a product**. Otherwise you will not be able to delete it.
