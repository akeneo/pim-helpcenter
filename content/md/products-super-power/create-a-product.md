# How?

You can create products directly in the PIM or through imports. Product’s creation is submitted to specific rights. Please note that you first need an identifier attribute created prior to add a product from the user interface.

To create a product
1.  Click on `Create product` on the top right corner of the product grid:
    ![Create a Product](../img/Products_views.png)
1.  Specify a unique product identifier
1.  Select a family for the new product
1.  Click on `Save`
    The product is created and its edit form is displayed, you can start filling its attributes. A product can be created without a family, but no attributes will be shown in the product edit form (a product automatically inherits from attributes set at the family level).
