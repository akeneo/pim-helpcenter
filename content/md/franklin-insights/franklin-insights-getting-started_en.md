# Overview

Welcome to Franklin’s world! Franklin is our new **product data intelligence assistant**, at your service :wink:

Franklin helps you on your catalog enrichment mission and guides you towards creating a **more compelling product experience, faster than ever before**.

:::info
For now, Franklin can assist retailers who operate in the United States.
:::
# Franklin activation

 Franklin credits are required in order to subscribe products for enrichment. PIM clients who purchase Franklin credits will receive an **activation code**. The activation code needs to be saved on the PIM on `System`/`Franklin Insights Connection` in order to enable communication between the PIM and Franklin.

::: warning
The Franklin activation failed? Please make sure that you pasted the code we provided correctly. If the issue persists, please let us know and we will be happy to assist :)
:::

The next step of the setup stage is to match between your catalog attributes and Franklin's identifiers on the **Franklin Identifiers Mapping UI** on `Settings`/`Franklin Insights`. You can learn more about this stage [here](franklin-insights-mappings.html#identifiers-mapping).
