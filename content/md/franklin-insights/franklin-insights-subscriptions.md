# Overview

Once you [activate the Franklin connection](franklin-insights-getting-started.html#franklin-activation) and perform the [mapping of Franklin identifiers](franklin-insights-mappings.html#identifiers-mapping), you have everything you need in order to **subscribe products to Franklin for automatic enrichment**.

When you subscribe a product to Franklin, Franklin **collects and validates information on demand** from hundreds of sources and its internal database, and then utilizes **Big Data, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning** in order to provide you with **rich, accurate, and structured product information suggestions**.

In order for you to receive attribute values proposals for subscribed and enriched products, you need to **match between Franklinâ€™s attributes and your catalog attributes** in each family using the [Franklin attributes mapping UI](franklin-insights-mappings.html#identifiers-mapping).

# Filter on subscribed products in the product grid

In order to easily find the subscribed or unsubscribed products, we added a filter `Franklin subscription` in the product grid. Thus, you can easily display the products in the grid and [bulk subscribe or unsubscribe](franklin-insights-subscriptions.html#via-bulk-action) them.

The available choices for this new filter are:
- `All`: products will be displayed in the product grid regardless of their subscription status
- `Enabled`: only the subscribed products will be displayed in the product grid
- `Disabled`: only the unsubscribed products will be displayed in the product grid

::: info
1. By default, the filter is set to `All`.
2. It is displayed only if [Franklin is activated](franklin-insights-getting-started.html#franklin-activation).
:::

::: tips
To make it even more comfortable to work with subscribed products, you can also use `Franklin subscription` [as a column](products-grid.html#configure-grid-columns) in the product grid.
