# Definition

A user group is a set of users grouped by a name. A user may be a part of several user groups.  
For example, the `Marketing Dpt` user group gathers all the users in the Marketing Department of the company. The `Managers` user group gathers all the users who are manager of a department. Some users can be in the `Marketing Dpt` only.

# What is the aim?
Well, we gathered people in groups of users. It's great but what is the aim?

In fact, it will be very useful for you, if you want to give different *permissions* to the users, according to the user groups they are in. This is an Entreprise Edition feature.  
If you want to know more about how to set up these advanced permissions, take a look at the [Build you user groups article](/articles/build-your-user-groups.html).

::: info
In the Community Edition, there is no permission applied on user groups. If you want to benefit from this feature, you'll have to upgrade to the [Entreprise Edition](https://www.akeneo.com/enterprise-edition/?source=akeneo-help).
