# Overview

You can easily restrict the edition or the execution of given [import](imports.html) and [export](exports.html) profiles depending on the [user groups](what-is-a-user-group.html) your users are in.

## Available rights

They are two available rights you can grant on each import/export profile:
- The right to execute it named `Allowed to execute job profile`: if granted, the users in the user group will be able to launch the job
- The right to edit it named `Allowed to edit job profile`: if granted, the users in the user group will be able to change its configuration, ie they will have access to the edition mode of the import/export profile
