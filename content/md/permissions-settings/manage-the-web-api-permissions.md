# Set permissions on the Web API

Permissions on the [Web API](https://api.akeneo.com) are also granted according to the [userâ€™s role(s)](what-is-a-role.html).

To change Web API permissions for one user role:
1. Go to `System` and click on the `Roles` menu entry
1. Click on the role to edit
1. Click on the `Web API Permissions` tab

1. Check/uncheck the permissions you want
1. Click on the `Save` button to confirm your changes

The following sections will give you a detailed explanation of what each permission grant. Do not hesitate to take a look.

# Give the overall access
First, there is a permission that grants access to the overall Web API. It is called `Overall Web API`.

If it is turned on for a given role, it will give an overall access to the API to the users that have this role. Meaning these users would be able to call any endpoints in the API.

If it is turned off, the users that have this role won't be able to make calls to the API endpoints.

# Give access by endpoints
You can also be more precise in terms of endpoints you want your API users to call.

The following tables sum up the permissions you will find to restrict the access to the API, endpoint by endpoint.
