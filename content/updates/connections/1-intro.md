# A new streamlined way to configure connectors from within the PIM

With Connections, you can easily add Source Connections (inbound feeds) from systems such as your ERP, MDM, DAM, or others used to create or update products, attributes, and assets.

You can also create Destination Connections (outbound feeds) meant to distribute product information, like an eCommerce platform, a publishing tool or a syndication solution.

These connections are not limited to collecting or distributing product information; you can also connect to other applications such as a translation tool.
