# Save time connecting the PIM to other applications!

With Connections, you will save time creating new credentials for all your new connectors. No need to first create a username and password, then generate a client ID and a secret â€” instead, all credentials will now be
automatically created when adding a new connection.

To easily set up connection permissions, you can now simply directly link your connection user to a role and a group from the setup page. Moreover, to seamlessly set up a connection to an external system, we added shortcut buttons to copy/paste connection credentials.

Finally, because the information displayed under the Connections can be sensitive, we added permissions on this feature, so you can define who can access the connections page.
