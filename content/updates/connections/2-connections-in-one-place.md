# All your connections in one single place

Any new source or destination connection will be visible in the Connections page. You can easily create or update any connection from this screen.

Connections are categorized depending on their flow types (source, destination or other), so you can quickly differentiate between source and destination connections.

You can also assign a logo or image to your connection, for instance, adding a Salesforce logo for your Salesforce Commerce Cloud Premium Connector, in order to more easily identify it.
