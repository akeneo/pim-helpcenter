# New warning messages on usernames connection
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Connections" available="27th of February"
:::

Whenever one of your connectors is not using the dedicated connection username, we will display you a warning message in the main Connections screen as well as in the Connection form.     
This warning message will mention which usernames were wrongly used for this connection and when they were used for the last time.    
The warning message will disappear if no wrong users are used over the past 7 days for the given connection. Thanks to this improvement, ensure API connection security and accesses.

Want to discover why we need to ensure this? Read the following [help center section](../articles/manage-your-connections.html#why-should-you-use-the-connection-username).
