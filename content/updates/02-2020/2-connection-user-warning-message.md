# Connection user warning message
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Connections" available="27th of February"
:::

We need to warn you whenever one of your connectors is not using the dedicated connection username. This warning message will appear both in the main Connections screen as well as in the Connection form. It mentions which usernames were wrongly used for this connection and when they were used for the last time. The warning message disappears if no wrong users were used over the past 7 days for the given connection.

Want to discover why we need to ensure this? Read the following [help center section](../articles/manage-your-connections.html#why-should-you-use-the-connection-username).
