To do operations on your media, we always convert them to png first, to avoid compression related losses. As a result, this conversion can increase the size of your images. To reduce your file size, we provide an optimize jpeg operation to convert them back to compressed jpeg files. ðŸ˜‰

With theÂ `optimize_jpeg`Â type, you can convert your images to jpeg and change their jpeg quality.
