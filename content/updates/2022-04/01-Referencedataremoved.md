# Reference Data Removed
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="mid-April" in="EE,GE"

Before the time of Reference Entities, its older relative called the Reference Data attribute remained. It created a bit of clutter, so in the spirit of a thorough Spring cleaning, we've hidden the ability to create Reference Data via the attribute creation modal. That means as an Akeneo PIM Enterprise Edition customer, you'll have a smoother experience. And our Akeneo PIM Growth Edition customers never need to be concerned about the differences between the older Reference Data attributes and the Reference Entities you enjoy using. Enjoy that clear, free air!
