# New warning message on connection usernames
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Connections" available="late February" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-connections.html#why-should-you-use-the-connection-username"
:::

Whenever one of your connectors is not using the dedicated connection username, we display a warning message in the main Connections screen as well as in the Connection form.

This warning message mentions which usernames were wrongly used for this connection and when they were used for the last time.    
Thanks to this improvement, we ensure the API connection security and accesses.

Want to discover why we need to guarantee this? Read our help center section about [why it is crucial to use the username of your connection](../articles/manage-your-connections.html#why-should-you-use-the-connection-username).
