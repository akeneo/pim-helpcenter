::: meta-data type="New" features="Governance" available="Late-November" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-multidimensional-data-in-a-table.html#what-about-the-completeness"

Completeness for your table attributes can now be defined at the table attribute level, on a selection of columns, or on every column. This allows you to fine-tune the requirements before you share your products to the world. The overall quality of the product experience you offer your buyers will skyrocket!
