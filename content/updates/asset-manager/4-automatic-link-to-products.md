# Automatically link assets to products with product link rules

With the new Asset Manager, you can also create automatic links between your assets and your PIM products, whether assets are stored externally or internally.

Product link rules help you save time in creating connections between assets and products. Each time a new asset is created in Akeneo, the rule is triggered and automatically links the asset to the right product!
