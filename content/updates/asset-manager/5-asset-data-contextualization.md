# Asset data contextualization

Akeneo’s new Asset Manager also makes it possible to contextualize asset-related information!

This new capability means you can have different attribute values (descriptions, names…), which vary by locale and/or channel. Asset values that differ by locale can be translated just like with other product attributes, helping you deliver an even better product experience.
