# Bulk Delete Attributes and Attribute Groups
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="April" in="EE,GE"

Once a catalog structure is created or imported in Akeneo PIM the only way to rebuild or restart it is to manually delete elements one by one, an extremely time-consuming process. Now you can speed this process and gain more flexibility to modelize your catalog directly in Akeneo PIM with the ability to bulk delete attributes and attribute groups. Select all the attributes you need to delete and use the dedicated bulk action option or choose one or more attribute groups that are no longer relevant. You will then be prompted to select the new attribute group that will gather those attributes if you still want to keep them in your instance.
