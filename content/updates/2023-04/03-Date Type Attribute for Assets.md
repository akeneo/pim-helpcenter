# Date Type Attribute for Assets
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="April" in="EE" link-to-doc="https://help.akeneo.com/serenity-manage-your-images-files-assets/serenity-manage-your-asset-families"

Add date-based information to assets with the new Date Type attribute. This information can support asset workflows by defining dates around key activities. For example, use this attribute to define a launch date when an asset can be distributed or an end-of-life date when an asset should be deleted or removed from circulation.
