# Multiple Identifier Generators Now Supported
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="April" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="https://help.akeneo.com/serenity-your-first-steps-with-akeneo/generate-product-identifiers"

Now you can set up multiple Identifier Generators in Akeneo PIM to automate the creation of product identifiers for specific product lines, business units or use cases. For example, you might create one Identifier Generator to define an identifier structure for shirts (Tshirt-Blue-M-001) and another to define a different identifier structure for accessories (Accessory-Hat-Wool-1453).
