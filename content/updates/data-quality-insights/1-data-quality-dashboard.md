# Monitor your data quality in a dashboard 

With the Data Quality Insights feature, you can easily **measure the quality of your product data and monitor it at a glance** in a dedicated dashboard.

This dashboard uses a **grading system based on enrichment and consistency**. The enrichment axis checks required and optional attributes, while the consistency axis monitors spelling and case formatting.

In addition to a global product catalog view, you can **focus on the quality of a specific category or family to better prioritize your tasks**.
