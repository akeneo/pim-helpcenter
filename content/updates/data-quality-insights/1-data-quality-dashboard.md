# A data quality dashboard 

With the Data Quality Insights feature, you can easily measure the quality of your product data and see at a glance how it measures up in a dedicated dashboard.

This dashboard uses a grading system based on enrichment and consistency. The enrichment axis checks required and optional attributes, while the consistency axis monitors spelling and case formatting.

In addition to a global product catalog view, you can focus on the quality of a specific category or family to better prioritize your tasks.
