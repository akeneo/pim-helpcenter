# New: execute asset naming conventions manually
::: meta-data type="New" features="Asset Manager" available="late June" link-to-doc="../articles/assets-product-link-rules.html#focus-on-the-naming-convention.html"
:::

In the Asset Manager, it is possible to define a naming convention in order to automatically populate asset attributes with values contained in the asset filename or asset code. This naming convention is executed at the asset creation.

From now on, you can manually re-execute this naming convention afterward. It can be very useful if your naming convention changes after the asset upload/creation for instance.

You have 2 ways to manually execute the naming convention:
- either in each asset edit form (it's a unitary action that saves the asset and execute the naming convention)

- or in the `product link rules` tab of your asset family (it's a mass action that executes the naming convention on all the assets of this asset family).
