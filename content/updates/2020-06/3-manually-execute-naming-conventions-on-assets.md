::: meta-data type="New" features="Asset Manager" available="late June" link-to-doc="../articles/assets-product-link-rules.html#focus-on-the-naming-convention.html"
:::

In the Asset Manager, it is possible to define a naming convention in order to automatically populate asset attributes with values contained in the asset filename or asset code. This naming convention is executed at the asset creation.


You have two ways to manually execute a naming convention:
- for one specific asset, directly in the asset edit form. The action is visible under the `...`

![Unitary execution](../img/unitary-execution.png)

- for an asset family, under the `product link rules` tab of your asset family - the naming convention will be applied to all assets belonging to this family.
