Do you want to easily create a new product from another? You can now duplicate a simple product in your user interface with one single click! What a time-saver! :wink:  
Find this new action under the `...` button at the top right corner of each of your product edit forms. 

This new feature also comes with a dedicated permission, so you can decide which group(s) of users can perform this action.
