You want to easily create a new product based on an existing one? You can now duplicate a simple product in your user interface in a single click! What a time-saver! :wink:  

Find this new action under the `...` button in the top right corner of each of your product edit forms.

This new feature also comes with dedicated permission, so you can decide which group(s) of users can perform this action.
