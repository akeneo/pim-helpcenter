# Rules engine updates

At Akeneo, we aim at delivering the best user experience. A good experience with our PIM goes with a good understanding of what is going on, especially when there are errors that you have to correct. The following improvements will enable you to better monitor rule executions, and easily correct errors that can occur in the rules engine when importing a YML file or when executing rules.

## Monitor rules execution under the process tracker

::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-June" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#execute-rules"
:::

From now on, every time you run a rule, a rule execution operation line will appear in your dashboard under the last operations as well as in the process tracker. Like for any other PIM job or operation, you can access the detailed execution page with a click. This execution page will inform you if the rule went fine or if it raised any errors or warnings, and give you guidance on how to fix them.

## Improved error messages after a rule import

::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="early June"
:::

Being able to quickly understand what happened after an import to fix errors easily is essential, so we improved some of our error messages to make sure they help you figure out how to fix what went wrong.
From now on, you know in which rule you'll find the error, and what the error is about.
