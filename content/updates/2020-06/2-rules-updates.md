# Rules engine updates

At Akeneo, we aim at delivering the best user experience. A good experience with our PIM goes with a good understanding of what is going on, especially when there are errors that you have to correct.

The following improvements will help you better monitor rule executions, and help you correct errors in the rules engine that can occur when importing a YML file or when executing rules.

## Monitor rules execution under the process tracker

::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-June" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-rules.html#execute-rules.html"
:::

From now on, every time you run a rule, a rule execution operation line will appear in your dashboard under the last operations and also in the process tracker.
From those pages, you can access a detailed execution page with a click, like for any other PIM job or operation. This execution page will inform you if the rule went fine or if it raised any errors or warnings.

## Improved error messages after a rule import

::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="early June"
:::

Being able to quickly understand what happened after an import to fix errors easily is essential, so we improved some of our error messages to make sure that they helped you figure out how to fix errors.
From now on, you know in which rule is the error, and what is the error.
