# New: option screen revamp
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Attribute options, Data Governance" available="late June" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-simple-and-multi-selects-attribute-options.html"
:::

Because single and multi-select attributes are in the top 5, we improved the 'option screen' user experience to ease creating or editing attribute options.

Apart from a great design and improved visibility on content, nothing has changed: you can still create and edit options for all your activated locales.

We felt we could do more to help you ensure data quality and ease your way to a great PX Score... so we are planning new improvements for next month. Stay tuned :wink:
