# Better manage your attribute options
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Attribute Options, Productivity, Data Governance" available="late June" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-attributes.html#manage-simple-and-multi-selects-attribute-options"
:::

The attribute options screen for single and multiple-select attributes has been completely redesigned to give you a better user experience.

Navigate more easily between your option codes and their translations, and manage your attribute options more efficiently! 

Apart from a great design and improved visibility on content, nothing has changed: you can still create and edit options for all your activated locales.

We felt we could do more to help you ensure data quality and ease your way to a great PX Score... so we are planning new improvements for next month. Stay tuned! :wink:
