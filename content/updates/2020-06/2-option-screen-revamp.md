# Better manage your attribute options
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Attribute Options, Data Governance" available="late June" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-your-attributes.html#manage-simple-and-multi-selects-attribute-options"
:::

We have improved the `Attribute option screen` to make it easier to create or edit attribute options, since single and multi-select attributes are among the attributes you use the most.

Apart from a great design and improved visibility on content, nothing has changed: you can still create and edit options for all your activated locales.

We felt we could do more to help you ensure data quality and ease your way to a great PX Score... so we are planning new improvements for next month. Stay tuned! :wink:
