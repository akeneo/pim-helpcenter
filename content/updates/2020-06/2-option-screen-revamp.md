Because single and multi-select are among the most used attributes, we improved the `Option screen` user experience to ease creating or editing attribute options.

Apart from a great design and improved visibility on content, nothing has changed: you can still create and edit options for all your activated locales.

We felt we could do more to help you ensure data quality and ease your way to a great PX Score... so we are planning new improvements for next month. Stay tuned! :wink:
