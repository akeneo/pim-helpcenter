# New API filter on product quality score
::: meta-data type="New" features="Connectivity" available="mid-February" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/filter.html#on-their-quality-score"

- or you want to select products on which proper enrichment work is still needed.

Here is how this new filter looks like:
