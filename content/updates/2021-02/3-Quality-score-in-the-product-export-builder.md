# Filter and export your product quality score
::: meta-data type="New" features="Quality, Collaboration" available="mid-February" in="EE,GE"

You can now export your product quality scores together with other product information directly from the product Export Builder. Easily filter on the quality scores you need, A, B, C, D, and/or E, before you can download the information in an Excel or CSV file.

This new feature can be very handy when:
- you want to only export high-quality products to distribute them to third-parties,
- you want to find products with a low score to allow contributors to focus on enhancing this product information to increase their catalog's quality score.

You can also choose on which locales you want this quality score filter to apply: to all of them or only one.

 If you want to export your quality score on existing product exports, you need to edit them to add this filter, by default, the quality score is not included in product export profiles.
