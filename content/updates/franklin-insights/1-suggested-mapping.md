# New suggested mapping feature

Franklin’s product data can be used in Akeneo PIM via the Franklin Insights feature. In addition to the “Exact Attribute Matches” feature that automatically maps attributes, we introduce the “Suggested Mapping” feature, which eases and accelerates attribute mapping in 4.0.

This feature analyzes and suggests Franklin’s attribute names that are similar to your product catalog attribute names. Once Franklin suggests the mapping, simply review it and save it. This will help you save time mapping your attributes to benefit from Franklin’s AI features.
