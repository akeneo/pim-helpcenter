# Exact match attribute mapping
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.2"

New in Franklin Insights is the ability to automatically map attributes where the fields are an exact match in Franklin and in the PIM catalog. This new capability reduces the need to do manual mapping only for fields where the attribute names are different.
