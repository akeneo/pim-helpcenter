## How does it work?

Franklin Insights offers an interface to visually map the attributes from the subscribed product data in Franklin to the product attributes in your Akeneo PIM catalog.

Once you have subscribed to a product identifier, Franklin generates and suggests a “golden record” of the highest quality technical data for the PIM. You map the Franklin attributes to the PIM attributes, and then Franklin generates a proposal for you to review.

When subscribing to products, you can benefit from receiving continuous updates to technical product data to ensure the highest quality of information is reflected in your catalog.

## Additional information
Franklin Insights requires a subscription to Franklin. Please contact your Akeneo representative for pricing information.
