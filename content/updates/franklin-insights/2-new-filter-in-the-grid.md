# Filter on subscribed products in the product grid
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.1"

Prior to version 3.1, all products were displayed by default. This filter lets you narrow your list of products to manage in Franklin Insights.

It makes it easier to identify which products are unsubscribed so that you can subscribe to them via a bulk action.

It allows you to select `All`, `Enabled` (or subscribed), and `Disabled` (or unsubscribed).

This filter can also be added as a column to show the subscription status at a glance.
