# Suggest creating new attributes
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.2"

If Franklin finds an attribute that does not exist in the PIM, a new `Create attribute` button appears so that in a single action, you can create the attribute and attach it to the family, without having to exit the attribute mapping screen.
