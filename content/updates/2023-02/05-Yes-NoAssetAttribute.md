# Yes/No Attribute Type for Assets
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="February" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="..manage-asset-families.html#create-an-asset-family"

The Yes/No attribute type allows teams to create extra stages for assets beyond “complete” and “not complete.” For example, the Yes/No attribute could be used to identify assets that are ready for public use, assets that are under an embargo, or assets that have passed a quality check. Attributes may be named by the Akeneo PIM user, so there is no limit to how the Yes/No option may be used to support asset management.
