# New filters for rules conditions
::: meta-data type="New" features="Automation, Productivity" available="early October"
:::

New condition filters are available in the rules engine to help you better narrow down your product selection for a rule. For instance, you can now target specific product models or variants, or a list of product identifiers.

You can now filter on:
- the entity type: to target product models or products and variant products,
- family variants: to target products belonging to one or several family variants, or products with one or no family variant,
- parents: to target specific product parents or products without parents
- identifiers: to target specific products based on their product identifiers.

Don't hesitate to use those new filters. The more precise your rule conditions, the faster it will be run.
