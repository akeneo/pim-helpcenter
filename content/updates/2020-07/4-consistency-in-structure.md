# Avoid spelling mistakes in your product data
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Data Quality Insights" available="late July"
:::

You can now benefit from spell-checking on attributes and option labels to guarantee the consistency on your customer-facing product data.

You can now check and correct spelling mistakes in attributes in the `Settings` pages.  
This improvement is also available in the product form. New recommendations are listed, should we find errors. The better the content, the higher the consistency grade! :wink:
