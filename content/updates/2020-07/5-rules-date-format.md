# New rules condition on relative dates
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-July"
:::

You can now create a rule based on a **relative date** condition. For now, this new format can only be used through YML import (it will be shortly available in our brand new rules engine screen!). You can use it on the `updated` and `created` system attributes and the `date` attribute type.

It was already possible to apply conditions on products/product models based on their `creation date`, `updated date`, or the content of a `date` attribute type. But we wanted to go further, by allowing you to not only filter on **specific dates** but also on **relative dates**. With this new functionality, you are able to apply an action on all the products created/updated for the past X days.
