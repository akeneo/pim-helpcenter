# New! Create and update rules from the PIM!
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-July"
:::

To make the use of the rules engine easier and boost your productivity, we created a brand new user interface to directly manage your rules in the PIM.  

![New screen to manage your rules](../img/Rules_UI.png)

Our rules engine enables you to automate enrichment actions on specific product selections. This new screen allows you to create, update and delete rules in a few clicks, it definitely makes rules management easier and faster.  
The imports of YML files to create or update rules remain available.

:::warning
All the conditions and actions are not available in the UI yet. We are adding more as we go. :wink:
