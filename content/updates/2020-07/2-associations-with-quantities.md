# New association type with quantities
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product Associations" available="early July"
:::

The new association type with quantities enables you to create product sets. You can associate several products together and define quantities for each of them. 

For instance, you can easily create a dining table set composed of 1 table and 4 chairs, just like this one:

![This is a product set composed of different associated products with quantities](../img/Dining-set_Felix.jpg)

Once you have created the right association type, and associated your products in the PIM, it will look like this:

Association with quantities was one of the most requested features, so why not giving it a try right now? :wink:
