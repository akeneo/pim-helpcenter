# New measurement units and families
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Measurements, Data Governance" available="mid-March"
:::

We added four new measurement families: `Force`, `Angle`,`Capacitance` and `Volume Flow` to better fit your needs in terms of product modeling.

Also, we completed some existing measurement families with new units:
- in `Pressure`: bar, pascal, etc.
- in `Binary`: kilobit, megabit, etc.
- in `Length`: micrometer and nautical mile units
- in `Volume`: microliter and hectoliter units
- in `Weight`: microgram unit

Of course, these new measurement families and units come with preset conversion operations to help you save some time.
