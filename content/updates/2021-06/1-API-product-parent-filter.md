# Easier product model retrieval within your connectors
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Connectivity" available="early June" in="EE,GE"

When you request product models via the REST API, you can ask for them to be filtered by their parent. It will help you separate more easily root product models from second-level product models.

On a related topic, we also added operators when you filter products by their parents. Thanks to those new operators, you can now easily:
- retrieve all the variant products of one or several given product models,
- choose whether you will get simple products only, or variant products only.
