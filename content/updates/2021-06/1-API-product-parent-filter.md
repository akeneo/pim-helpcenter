# Easier product model retrieval within your connectors
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Connectivity" available="early June" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/filter.html#on-their-parent-2"

When requesting product models via the REST API, you can now ask to filter them on their parent. It will help you separate more easily root product models from second-level product models.

On a related topic, we also added operators when filtering products via their parents. Thanks to those new operators, now you can easily:
- retrieve all the variant products of one or several given product models,
- choose whether you will get simple products only, or variant products only.
