# Create private views
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="late November"

Stay organized in your product enrichment thanks to private views! From now on, when you create a view, you can make it **private** to keep it for yourself and have it only visible by you, or **public** to share it with other PIM users. This improvement will help you to focus on your own enrichment needs without confusing your teammates.
