# Greater Visibility of Product Criteria and Product Counts in Catalogs for Apps
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="December" in="EE,GE" link-to-doc="../articles/manage-product-identifiers.html"

If youâ€™re using Akeneo Apps, then you know that a catalog is a selection of products defined by one or several criteria like families or categories. When you want to choose those criteria you can now view all available filterable attributes, making it easy to access the data you need. In addition, the number of products that match the selected criteria are now displayed to better help you configure product selections.
