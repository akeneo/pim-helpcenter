# Link to products
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.0"

You can link your new reference entity records to products through two new product attributes types:
- Reference entity single link (for example: linking one brand to
a product),
- Reference entity multiple links (for example: linking several care
instructions to a product).
