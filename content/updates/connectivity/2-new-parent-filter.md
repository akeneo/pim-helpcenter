# New `parent` API filter when exporting products
::: meta-data eeOnly="false" since-version="3.2"

A brand new filter for your product API requests is now available: the `parent` filter. You can now very easily retrieve the variant products of a given product model, whether itâ€™s a root or sub-product model.

This way, you can easily re-construct the product models/variant products trees in the connector side.
