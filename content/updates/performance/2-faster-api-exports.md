# Faster API exports
::: meta-data eeOnly="false" since-version="3.2"

Version 3.2 includes performance improvements in product exports via the API. Export via the API is now 5 times faster on average compared to exports via Excel or CSV. Export performance also depends on the “size” of your products. 

For example, for products with an average of 400 values, you’ll now be able to export more than 200,000 products per hour, or 57 products per second. For products with 50 values per product, you can export nearly 700,000 products per hour, or 192 products per second.
