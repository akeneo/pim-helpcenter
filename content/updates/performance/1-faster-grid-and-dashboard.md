# Faster grid and dashboard
::: meta-data eeOnly="false" since-version="3.0"

The product grid is the most used screen in the PIM. In 3.0, we wanted to make sure that it has great performances: the product grid now loads in less than 2 seconds with 1,000,000 products and 20,000 categories. 

If you need a large set of attributes to describe their products, we have more good news for you! You are now able to use as many attributes defined as grid filter as you want. This number will no longer have an impact on product grid
loading performance.

Another visible improvement is the time to load the Dashboard and the completeness widget is significantly faster than in prior versions.
