# Browse your Events API logs
::: meta-data type="New" features="Connectivity" available="late March" in="EE,GE"

To ease the debugging of your Events API-based connections, we introduced a brand new monitoring screen to display the Events API logs, from info and notices to warnings and even errors. A great addition to help you find the root causes of synchronization problems and also, without a doubt, a welcomed time-saver to understand what happened on your connections!

You can find this new screen in the `Event logs` menu of each connection. Note that you can use the date and level filters to narrow down the selection of displayed logs.

Finally, you can also download these logs in `.txt` format.
