# New measurement units for a better product modeling
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Measurements, Data Governance" available="19th of March"

To better fit your needs in terms of product modeling and to make sure you provide the most accurate product information to your customers, we added four new measurement families: `Force`, `Angle`,`Capacitance` and `Volume Flow`.

Also, we completed some existing new measurement families with new units:
- in `Pressure`: bar, pascal, etc.
- in `Binary`: kilobit, megabit, etc.
- in `Length`: micrometer and nautical mile units
- in `Volume`: microliter and hectoliter units
- in `Weight`: microgram unit

Of course, these new measurement families and units come with preset conversion operations to help you save some time.
