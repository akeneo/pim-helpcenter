To help always achieve a better data quality content, **spell-check and suggestions are now available on text area attributes having the rich text editor enabled** (WYSIWYG).

The spell-check feature now **supports four new languages**: Italian 🇮🇹, Swedish 🇸🇪, Danish 🇩🇰 and Dutch 🇳🇱. This means that you can now have spelling mistakes automatically detected for no more than 8 locales. Mistakes are no longer allowed! :wink:
