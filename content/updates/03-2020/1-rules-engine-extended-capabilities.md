# Rules engine extended capabilities

## A new rule action to concatenate attributes

:::
A new `concatenate` rule action is now available and will certainly boost your rules engine usage! This new action will enable you to **concatenate at least two attribute values together**, and to set the resulting value in another attribute.   
For instance, you want to make sure your product titles are always formatted the same way. Create a rule to concatenate your product attributes `name` + `color` + `size` and set this new value chain into your `product title` attribute. Use this rule to enhance your product content!

## More automation with the `copy` action

:::
Ease and speed up your product enrichment thanks to the extended capabilities of the `copy` action from our rules engine! You can now **copy the value from an attribute type to another attribute type**. For instance, you can create a rule to copy an option from a simple select attribute to a reference entity single link, instead of manually copy/pasting it. By automating the copy of values, **you make sure you have the right data in the right place**, this will get rid of some manual and error-prone tasks.
