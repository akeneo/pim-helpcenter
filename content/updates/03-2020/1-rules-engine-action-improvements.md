# Rules engine action improvements

## New action: `Concatenate`
A new `concatenate` action is available to boost the rules engine usage! Thanks to the concatenate action, it is now possible to concatenate two attribute values or more, in a destination attribute. For example: concatenate the `Brand` attribute + the `Model` attribute to create the `Product name`. ðŸ˜‰

## New capabilities for the `copy` action
Up to now, it was possible to copy values from an attribute to another one that was the same attribute type. For example: from a text attribute to another text attribute.  
We have expanded the possibilities of the copy action, by allowing you to copy from a certain attribute type to another attribute type. For example : from a text attribute to a text area attribute.  
You will find all the specifications in this [dedicated article](../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#copy).
