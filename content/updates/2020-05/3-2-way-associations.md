Easily handle product compatibility in your PIM thanks to our **brand new two-way association type**! This new association type is now available under `Settings`/`Association types`.

If you choose the two-way association type, and associate product A with product B, product B will **automatically** be associated with product A.

Use a two-way association if you need to easily link substitute or replacement items, or products that are compatible such as appliances and spare parts.
