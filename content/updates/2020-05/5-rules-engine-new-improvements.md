# Rules engine improvements

Small UI enhancements and a new parameter for your calculation action, those are the last improvements of the rules engine!

## New action tags for your rules

:::

From now on, you can see at a glance the action type behind each rule (add, copy, concatenate, set, calculate, remove, clear) in the rules grid. To ease your readability, each action type has its own color. :wink:

## Round your calculation results with a new parameter
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity, Rules engine" available="late May" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#calculate"
:::

To give you more flexibility and ensure your data is in the right format, our brand new `round_precision` parameter enables you to round the final result of your rule operation(s).  For instance, define the number of decimals you need or remove all decimals.
