# More visibility on PIM jobs
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity" available="mid-May"
:::

To give you more visibility and control on all PIM jobs, we added a new permission: `View all jobs in the Process Tracker` to see all jobs of any status under the Process Tracker.

You will now be able to see the ongoing or previous PIM jobs and, if needed, which users launched them. :wink:
