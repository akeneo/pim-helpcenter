# More visibility on PIM jobs
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Productivity, Permissions, Process tracker" available="mid-May" link-to-doc="../articles/monitor-jobs.html#how-to-monitor"
:::

To give you more visibility and control on all PIM jobs, we added a new permission: `View all jobs in the Process Tracker` to see all jobs of any status under the Process Tracker.

You will now be able to see the ongoing or previous PIM jobs and, if needed, which users launched them. :wink:
