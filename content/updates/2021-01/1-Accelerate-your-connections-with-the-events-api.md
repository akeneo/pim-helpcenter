# Accelerate your connections with the Events API
::: meta-data type="New" features="Connectivity" available="mid-January" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/events-documentation/introduction.html"

You may know how crucial it is to efficiently connect your PIM to third-party applications such as your ERP, eCommerce platform, or DAM. To help you speed up on this topic, we're launching a brand new API, called the `Events API`.

Coupled with our [existing REST API](https://api.akeneo.com/documentation/introduction.html), the Events API offers an additional and complementary way to synchronize PIM data with third-party applications. By reducing synchronization delays, it gives you the power to accelerate the access and distribution of your product information.

This new feature can be activated in the new tab named `Event subscription` for each connection. Don't hesitate to try it out; we're eager to hear your feedback!
