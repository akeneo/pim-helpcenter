# Product associations update


## View the number of associations per product
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product associations, Productivity, Data Governance" available="mid-April" link-to-doc="../articles/products-associations.html#view-the-products-associations"
:::

We now display the **total number of associations per product or product model nearby the `Associations` tab** when you are your product form.    
You can now quickly see the number of associations for your products.

We also show you the **total number of associations per association type**, when you are on your product associations page.

## Easy access to associations
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product associations, Productivity, Data Governance" available="10th of April" link-to-doc="../articles/products-associations.html#open-an-associated-product"
:::

Many of you were asking for it... From the `Associations` tab, you can now click on an associated product or product model and have it displayed in a new tab!

## Association screen improvement
::: meta-data type="New" features="Product associations, Productivity" available="mid-April" link-to-doc="../articles/products-associations.html"
:::

Until now, when opening the associations screen to associate more product with a product, the label of your product was not visible. We now display it under the title! This way we make sure you never lose track of what you are doing, even when a colleague of yours interrupt you during your work!
