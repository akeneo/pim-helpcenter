## Number of associations

## Easy access to associations
From the `Associations` tab, you can now open, in a new tab, an associated product or product model by clicking on it.

## More context in the associations popin
When you associate some products to another, we added the label of the current product in the product association picker, so that you can easily remember on which product you are working.
