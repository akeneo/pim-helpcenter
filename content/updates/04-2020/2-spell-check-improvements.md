# Spell-check improvements
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Quality, Data Quality Insights" available="30th of April"

## New languages
To allow you to benefit even more from this feature, 3 new locales are now available: 
- Norwegian BokmÃ¥l ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´, 
- Norwegian Nynorsk ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡´, 
- Brazilian Portuguese ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡·. 

The feature already covers English ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸, French ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·, Spanish ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸, German ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª, Italian ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹, Swedish ğŸ‡¸ğŸ‡ª, Danish ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡°, and Dutch ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± meaning that spelling mistakes can be detected and improved for **11 locales** now!

## For single locale PIM
Prior to this release, only localisable attributes could benefit from the spell-check feature released in 4.0. Now, the feature is also available for non-localisable attributes when there is only one locale activated. This means that if you have a catalog with only one activated locale, you can now benefit from spell-check on all your text and text area attributes, if your locale is one of the supported languages.
