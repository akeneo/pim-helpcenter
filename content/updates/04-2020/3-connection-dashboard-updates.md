## Source connections charts improved
We reworked the display of the two charts about the source connections in the Connection dashboard. We also now compute the sum on the last 7 days of the number of products created and updated.

## Track your destination connections
You can now easily track the number of products that were sent to your destinations in the Connection dashboard. You can consult this metric for each of the last 7 days. We also compute the sum of the last 7 days.

By default, new connections won't be monitored. If you want to activate their tracking, check the dedicated option in the Connection setting page.

You now have more control over the connections you want to track in the Connection Dashboard!
