Following last month improvements on product variants, the data quality insights tab listing recommendations and grades is **now also available for product models**. You can now see the enrichment and consistency grading scores for all attributes and see at glance on which level the attribute is (product variant or model level).

This improvement now enables you to easily monitor **your data quality and accuracy for all your products**.

## Spell-check: new languages supported!
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Quality, Data Quality Insights" available="30th of April"
:::

Three new locales are now supported for the spell-check features: Norwegian BokmÃ¥l ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´, Norwegian Nynorsk ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ and Brazilian Portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·.

The spell-check feature now can help you **improve your product information and avoid mistakes for 11 locales**!

## For single locale PIM
Prior to this release, only localisable attributes could benefit from the spell-check feature released in 4.0. Now, the feature is also available for non-localisable attributes when there is only one locale activated. This means that if you have a catalog with only one activated locale, you can now benefit from spell-check on all your text and text area attributes, if your locale is one of the supported languages.
