Following last month improvements on product variants, the data quality insights tab listing recommendations and grades is **now also available for product models**. You can now see the enrichment and consistency grading scores for all attributes and see at a glance on which level the attribute is (product variant or model level).

This improvement now enables you to easily monitor **your data quality and accuracy for all your products**.

Three new locales are now supported for the spell-check features: Norwegian Bokmål 🇳🇴, Norwegian Nynorsk 🇳🇴 and Brazilian Portuguese 🇧🇷.

The spell-check feature now can help you **improve your product information and avoid mistakes for 11 locales**!

## For single locale PIM
For those of you who have a catalog with only one activated locale, we have good news for you. You can now benefit from spell-check on all your text and text area attributes, if your locale is one of the supported languages.
