# Rules engine updates
::: meta-data type="New features" features="Rules engine" available="9th of April"

## Name your rules
We added the possibility to import a label to the rules. If no label is defined, we use the code between `[ ]`. It enables you to name your rules properly. :wink:

You can also preview the labels in the rules grid, and even filter on.

## New action: `Clear`
It is now possible to automatically clear attribute values. You can also automatically clear categories, groups and associations of a product selection.

## New format to set/add associations in the rules engine
It was already possible to automatically set or add associations to products/product models/groups with the rules engine, but the format was a bit complex. In this version, we simplified it.

## New action: `Calculate`
It is now possible to use the rules engine to automatically do computations such as calculateing volumes, marging rates, etc.
