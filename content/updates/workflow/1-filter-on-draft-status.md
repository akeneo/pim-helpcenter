# Filter on draft status in the product grid
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.2"

As part of the enrichment workflow, changes to products are normally reviewed and approved prior to distributing the catalog.

To make it easier to review the list of products, version 3.2 introduces a new “draft status” filter in the product grid. This makes it easier for contributors to follow the enrichment workflow and focus their work, leading to improved productivity and faster catalog completeness
