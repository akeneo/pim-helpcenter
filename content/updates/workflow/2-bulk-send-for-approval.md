# Bulk and sequential edit and send draft for approval
::: meta-data eeOnly="true" since-version="3.2"

Prior to 3.2, sending draft for approval could only be performed on one product at a time via the `Send for approval` button. In 3.2, workflow validation can now occur as a sequential edit or as a bulk edit. In the sequential edit, the `Send and next` button enables you to immediately send drafts for approval and then move on to the next item to review.

Similarly, a new checkbox in Bulk Actions lets you send multiple products for validation at once.
