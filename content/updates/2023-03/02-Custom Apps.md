Sometimes you need to extend the capabilities of your Akeneo PIM and the functionality doesnâ€™t exist out-of-the-box. With Custom Apps from Akeneo you can meet your specific individualized business scenarios, like unique features or a custom look and feel, while still taking advantage of the Akeneo SaaS platform. Custom Apps are SaaS-compliant apps developed by you, the Akeneo customer, or a third-party developer that are available only to your organization.
