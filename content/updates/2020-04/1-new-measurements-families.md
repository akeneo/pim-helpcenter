# New: add your own measurement units

## A new screen to manage measurements

**In order to give you more flexibility, we have improved the way we manage metrics in the PIM.**    
We are very glad to introduce our **new `Measurements` feature**.
Alongside standard measurement families (eg. weight, length, volume...), create your custom measurement families per your needs (eg. inductance, luminance...) and add the units you deem necessary (Henry, Lambert...).

If you want additional units for an existing or new measurement family, easily add them manually directly from the user interface.

You now have **full control over your measurement families**: easily add, update, or delete measurement units or measurement families that you are not using.

## New dedicated API endpoints
::: meta-data type="New" features="Measurements, Data Governance" available="mid-April" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference-index.html#Measurementfamily"

We also introduced two new API endpoints for the measurement families:
- A first endpoint to [retrieve all the measurement families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#measurement_families_get_list) with their units and conversion,
- A second endpoint to [create and update measurement families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#patch_measurement_families) with their units and conversion.

Our previous endpoints about [metric families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#Measurefamily) still work but the new ones are more powerful. Indeed, they allow creating/updating measurement families and they guarantee the order of the conversion calculations.
