# Data Quality Insights made even more powerful
Data Quality Insights recommendations and grades are now also available for product models to help you ensure that all your products have enriched and consistent content. Also, our spell-check feature now supports additional languages.

Following last month improvements on product variants, the data quality insights tab listing recommendations and grades is **now also available for product models**. You can now see the enrichment and consistency grading scores for all attributes and see at a glance on which level the attribute is (product variant or model level).

This improvement now enables you to easily monitor **your data quality and accuracy for all your products**.
