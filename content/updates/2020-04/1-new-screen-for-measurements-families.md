In order to give you more flexibility, we have improved the way we manage metrics in the PIM. Discover our new Measurements feature now!

Alongside standard measurement families (eg. weight, length, volume...), create your custom measurement families per your needs (eg. inductance, luminance...) and add the units you deem necessary (Henry, Lambert...).

![Measurement families list screen](../img/Settings_Measurement_Families-updates.png)

If you want additional units for an existing or new measurement family, easily add them manually directly from the user interface.

![Edition of units](../img/Settings_Measurement_Families_Edit_Unit-updates.png)

You now have **full control over your measurement families**: easily add, update, or delete measurement units or measurement families that you are not using.
