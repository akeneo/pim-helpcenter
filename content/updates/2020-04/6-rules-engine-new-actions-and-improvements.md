# Rules engine new actions and improvements
Discover the latest enhancements on the rules engine: we added two new actions and the possibility to name your rules. We also improved the rules format for associations.

## Calculate attribute values

:::

**From complex to simple calculations, the `Calculate` rule action enables you to do mathematical operations to fill in attributes based on other attribute values**. Multiply your length, width and height attributes to get a volume, or create a more complex calculation to forecast your margin.
**No more time wasted calculating values, the `Calculate` action does it for you.**

## Empty product values
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity, Automation" available="early April" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#clear"
:::

**Easily empty attribute values thanks to the new `Clear` rule action!** Automatically remove values from any attribute: a date, a price, a simple-select.. or any other field based on specific conditions. This new action also allows you to remove categories from a product, or ungroup/disassociate products from others automatically.

## Name your rules
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity, Automation" available="early April" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#name-your-rules"
:::

You can now **name your rules with a clear label**. And that's not it, you can define a rule name per PIM locale enabled. The rule's label is visible under your rules grid and under your smart attributes, if you have international teams you can now make sure that they understand the purpose of a rule.

## Set or add association actions improved
::: meta-data type="Improvement" features="Rules engine, Productivity, Automation" available="early April" link-to-doc="../articles/get-started-with-the-rules-engine.html#add-associations"
:::

It was already possible to automatically set or add associations to products/product models/groups with the rules engine, but the format was a bit complex. **We simplified the format so that it is easier for you to use those actions.**
