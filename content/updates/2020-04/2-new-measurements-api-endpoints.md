# New endpoints to manage measurements
::: meta-data type="New" features="Measurements, Data Governance" available="mid-April" link-to-doc="https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference-index.html#Measurementfamily"
:::

We introduced two new API endpoints to create, update and list your measurement families.

They are the following:
- A first endpoint to [retrieve all the measurement families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#measurement_families_get_list) with their units and conversion,
- A second endpoint to [create and update measurement families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#patch_measurement_families) with their units and conversion.

Our previous endpoints about [metric families](https://api.akeneo.com/api-reference.html#Measurefamily) still work but the new ones are more powerful. Indeed, they allow creating/updating measurement families and they guarantee the order of the conversion calculations.
