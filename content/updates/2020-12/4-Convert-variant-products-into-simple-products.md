# Convert variant products into simple products
::: meta-data type="New" features="Governance, Productivity" available="late December"

To offer greater flexibility when dealing with variant products, you can now easily transform them into simple products directly from the PIM interface. Quite a game changer when you need to refine your family variants! You can also use it if your product range now contains one product instead of several.

On a side note, this new feature will also help you change the family variants of your product model more efficiently. A real time saver indeed.
