# A new user interface for quick exports
::: meta-data type="New" features="Collaboration, Productivity" available="mid-September"
:::

For a better user experience, we created a new user interface to make it easier for you to generate a quick export from the product grid.

![New quick export UI](../img/Quick-export-new-UI_Export-with-labels.png)

To help you save time, the custom choices you make for your XLSX or CSV quick export are saved. So next time you click on `Quick export`, the last export configuration will be displayed.  

We hope you will enjoy it :wink:
