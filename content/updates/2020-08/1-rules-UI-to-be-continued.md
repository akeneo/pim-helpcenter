# More and more capabilities in your rules builder interface!
::: meta-data type="New" features="Rules engine, Productivity" available="mid-August"
:::

As you may know, we recently introduced a brand new user interface to enable you to manage your rules directly in the PIM! We are still adding new filters (aka the `conditions`) and `actions` to make it more powerful!

The whole conditions and actions will be ready soon, stay tuned!
