# Advanced product export capabilities
::: meta-data type="New" features="Productivity" available="mid-August" in="EE"

We are pleased to introduce a new export feature called **Tailored Exports**. From your export jobs, Tailored Exports allow you to customize your product export structure, content and sources. Thanks to Tailored Exports, you can now easily create and export XLSX files per your or your stakeholders' needs, or per channel requirements. Its interface enables you to easily define, select, rename and reorder columns, without having to manipulate the data further once exported. This new capability will be enriched with more functionalities in the coming weeks, stay tuned!
